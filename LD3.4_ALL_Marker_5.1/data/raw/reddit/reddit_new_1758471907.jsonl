He's still in touch with his ex", "selftext": "This story is a bit long, but I'll try to just tell you the important parts.\n\nI started seeing him less than a year ago, we weren't anything formal. He had just broke up with his ex, he kept the cats and the apartment.\n\nWe usually just hang out in my apartment, I preferred it that way. Until I realised he would never invite me to his. He then confessed this other woman went there to see the cats from time to time (silly me let this pass).\n\nFast forward to August. He was with me one morning after staying. He said he would go see the cats and come back. He didn't come back, who came was his \"ex\". She had his location on her phone, and saw he spent months coming here. I didn't want to talk to her, so I just said it was the wrong apartment. I was scared and confused, she introduced herself as his girlfriend. \n\nShe then found my IG and sent me a message saying that they're been in a relationship for 6 years and live together. I didn't reply. He was lying to both of us.\n\nHe then appeared and asked me if he could stay with me for a couple of weeks until he found a place to stay. Of course, this woman threw him out of the apartment and he had nowhere to stay, and hit him with a glass ashtray (he has a bruise on his forehead). I agreed (stupid ), and now he's staying here with the condition he's leaving on October 1st.\n\nHis birthday was September 11th. He told me he would go to see his sisters. When he arrived I could tell he took a shower, because his hair smelled different. When I went to grab some clothes, I discovered he had a book with a writing by his \"ex\" wishing him the best. Of course, they met that day.\n\nI'm furious. I'm thinking of telling this woman that he's been staying here, because she obviously doesn't know. He wouldn't tell her. Also, I forgot to add, he unfollowed me on IG, because this woman wouldn't give him his stuff while he still had me there. Until this day he hasn't followed me back. Which tell me he's still in touch with her, and even maybe thinks in getting back to the apartment they lived together in. \n\nShould I contact her and tell her? I'm so pissed off, but don't want to do anything that might affect me more than him. \n\nI'm so so angry, he doesn't appreciate anything. He doesn't love me, nor her. This is ridiculous; I'm telling him to leave. \n\nAnd yeah, I'm well aware of my part in all of this.\n\nTL;DR: We were seeing each other until his \"ex\" appeared and said there were in a relationship. I allowed him to stay with me until he finds a place to stay (she threw him off). He's still in touch with this woman, they met behind my back. I want to tell her he's been with me.", "created_utc": 1758470778.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmvwlg/i_37f_gave_him_31m_a_place_to_stay_hes_still_in/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false}

I’m from a village near Gwalior(India), studied most of my life, and helped my father on the farm. A couple of years ago, I joined IT and mostly worked from home during COVID. About a year ago, I moved to Indore for work but stayed low-key as I’m not very social.\n\nAround 9–10 months back, a friend introduced me to a girl at work who needed some guidance. We mostly talked about work, but I slowly started liking her. She’s the first girl I felt comfortable with, her smile and voice just make my day. We shared little stories and laughed at silly things, and she honestly felt special.\n\nLater she got assigned to WFH, and I couldn’t ask her out in person, so I did it over text. She said she didn’t feel the same way. I respected that and didn’t push. Now that she’s back in the office, things are awkward. She avoids lunch with me and doesn’t talk much. I’d like to show I fully respect her decision and just be friends. How can I remove this awkwardness and rebuild a normal friendship?", "created_utc": 1758470707.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmvvhv/how_can_i_remove_the_awkwardness_and_rebuild_a/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

How should I handle this?", "selftext": "So I have this friend (that I also started to like beyond friendship two months ago) and we work on the same area of a company, we are separated in different groups and usually chat at work and look for each other when available there, we also even leave work together and sometimes plan stuff to hang out outside work. However I noticed he has a tendency of not giving much care to texts when I text him, he told me if I call he usually always answers but he had a free day on Friday and I texted him, asked him how things were going he replied and then when I replied he has not replied till today, we also are in a course together and I talked with the teacher via the group about payment (I pay for both of us, he pays me his part later) and has not even said a thing about it. He is a very busy person but I always see he answers quite fast to text messages and stuff so I find it kind of annoying that he left me hanging since Friday.\n\nI'm even planning on not texting him to see what he does, I also want to ask him if we only hang out and all of that because we work in the same building and that when he or I change jobs for a better one we will eventually drift apart because of lack of contact. \n\nMaybe he needs time for himself (We see each other everyday and he seems to enjoy my company), am I being too intense with something insignificant? Are my newfound feelings for this guy maybe clouding my judgement?

{"id": "1nmvavt", "subreddit": "relationships", "title": "Girl 21F Holding Her Friends 23M Passport for 2 Weeks", "selftext": "I (M, late 20s) have been close with this girl “Kenzie” (F, early 20s) and her group for a few years. Lately things between us have felt off, and something that happened recently has me questioning whether I’m being paranoid or whether there are real red flags.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I lost my passport at her place. Instead of giving it back quickly, it dragged out and got weird. One night I texted her beforehand asking if I could grab it. She replied, “kk, one sec,” so I started walking toward her house. But when I got there, she walked in front of me and got into an Uber with another friend, leaving me standing across the street. While in the Uber, she texted me to walk into her unlocked home and grab the passport, saying no one was home. That felt sketchy, especially since she lives in a rougher part of town.\n\nA few additional context points:\n\t•\tBack in May, Kenzie and her friends decided to start using cocaine. I’m not judging, but it may explain some of the changes I’ve noticed in her behavior since then.\n\t•\tShe asked me to delete an innocent hug photo of us. She says it was because her cleavage was showing, but the tone of the message felt harsh and demanding.\n\t•\tShe’s been distant in general, and since that initial reply, she’s only written back once.\n\t•\tWhen I poured out a long message explaining how I felt (worried, confused, unsafe), her reply was defensive and didn’t properly address the passport situation or the events that made me uncomfortable.\n\nHere are the two texts we exchanged so you can see both sides:\n\nMale Friend: Kenzie, I never heard back after you left with Isbela in the Uber…and me and Pastor John just stood there confused AF. This is my long raw emotion all the way to you and I’m sorry that it reads like a book. I’m just gonna rip the bandaid right off tho and ask What the Fuck is actually going on, Kenzie?? Forreal! Nothing about you has felt the same since May… and you have become a person I feel like I no longer know to a degree which hurts and scares the shit out of me. Beyond breaks my heart to even type or say, but your not acting like you anymore…you’ve become so unfamiliar to me, that aside from your outward appearance, I almost feel like I’ve lost you to a much more corrupted version of yourself. Are you legit okay?? I mean … Why would you EVER think I would EVER EVEN consider just going into your home, with NO ONE there, as you walk in front of me and get in a Uber?? Talk about red flags and not making sense. and I don’t know who’s in your home or not for real, Miguel could be in there and next thing I know I’m one on one, and It’s not like it hasn’t happened before to me obviously with very different people, but I know that it concerned the fuck out of my friend Nevaeh that you even kept my property for that long, and she was really adamant that I didn’t go over there alone, which even Pastor John repeated…none of this even makes sense, Sweetheart. You knew I was literally across the street, you literally could’ve just said come grab it real quick and I would’ve and then just ran back over to Coons. I thought if you were gonna pull anything like that, you would’ve just told me somebody else was gonna hand it to me at the door, but you legitimately wanted me to go into your residence, with no cameras on or present, into a private home alone and me not see something extremely wrong with that?? You legit shouldn’t be even leaving your doors unlocked, especially where you’re living now. 13th  has gotten kinda bad. Someone could have like hidden in your house and  when you got back and you don’t even know it until they jump out of whatever room. There’s no way you never seem like True Crime shows….So, Kenzz, please just tell me what I did to make you wanna ever distance yourself from me on such a serious level?? I literally could have been killed that night I dropped that gift off because you didn’t wanna tell me you already were out…I knew something was up right then, but when the phone stopped ringing and pinging and instead of heart emojis and reposts, I got you texting me twice demanding I take down a photo that once I found it, it made me really question how you and I viewed it… especially considering your face is covered up in it too and we’re embraced in a very cute little hug…aleast that’s how I viewed it…So, What are you hiding?? Some innocent hug from Stevie??? … huh??? or is there something more I’m just not seeing?? I am not saying I am right or that you’re wrong and please don’t let this text come off argumentative because that’s the exact opposite of how I feel. \n\nThe acting so differently to me now in private than in public tho leaves even more questions, but that was much more something unrelated to you personally. I leave this city for my next chapter very very soon, in which I’m forever grateful for the year I took off, but I truly say goodbye to all of you in that, so it’s not like we even have much time left, but I know things have shifted to a really fucked level, when people wanna go leave things in their house with the doors unlocked as they leave to go to the club that presumably is the SAME club that my phone would ring or text off the hook about “STEVEEE COME OUT!” … I mean, you’d be wondering too if you were me. When the photos end up posted tho that show the real raw emotion, that can’t be hidden because of how obvious and real it is and some do much more than others, to the rush I witnessed to delete some of just the tags to avoid other people seeing that when they’re practically holding me with “hands all over” in some of the photos and almost kissing me in others, tells me obviously they don’t want they’re private feelings to show publicly or maybe they don’t even want me to see those private feelings, may they be romantic feelings, or something straight up different , some of the photos I posted and this is again unrelated to you, very obvious to the other people I show them to also say they see some romantic undertone to it, I have to wonder even more then… Why are my friends that are signed to some of the same modeling agencies as the models in our friend group showing the same embracement both publicly and privately without their even being a noticeable difference?? I honestly just wanted to think it came down to the hair color being pink or something, but that’s not the case. The lackluster response when you all saw me that night was very noticeable in contrast to what I’m used to from you all in the past and the other people in my life. and I don’t even spend money on them whatsoever. They weren’t even ever ask me. (Not saying you do or did since tone easily can be lost in text.) the only thing I know I fucked up with was my panicked slip up with the coke shit to Emily in-which I told you how sorry I was for. And I am! Do you really hold a grudge like that?? Obviously, I didn’t do that to throw you under the bus. Just like I didn’t bring up the shit with Emily that was said to try to throw her under the bus either, the emotions getting so high so quick tells me that you guys aren’t at that maturity level to even discuss open things of that nature and have open debate which you all should be far beyond capable of having. I was scared tho in my reaction, I went and got Narcan, and test shit to make sure you were all safe. I was worried the same way you were when I came out of the bathroom  about 2 weeks ago on Ketamine and you all pretty much freaked. You weren’t mad, you were concerned like me. Least for what felt like a few minutes. Then once we get back, you dip out, had somebody who already was part of a business discussion earlier in that day with me, come randomly over twice, and you never come back, and then when you see me post on IG, you’re not showing any love, care or excitement, NOTHING like 2024, NOTHING like my other  friends, where you can just read the comments alone that you left on last year‘s recap, vs this year’s, with you actually texting me telling me to delete shit off my own page which I literally only did because of how close we have been, and the fact I do legit respect you… i’ve never had anybody ask that ever and usually, it’s the opposite, I delete a pic and they get fucking way over the top hurt about it, not be the one to tell me to delete it especially using the tone you did. My Self-respect is simply too high for me to be even Talked to like that in the first place by you. I have a lot of other photos like that of us Too, and I don’t think you would’ve EVER had a problem with those photos being posted in the past, even if you were black out drunk, or whether you even remembered/remember taking them. I thought it was some photo of something completely different, not me and you just giving each other a little innocent hug…wtf? the other girls I roll with were beyond happy and waiting with love pouring when I posted photos of me and them similar to that. And for someone who claims they thought I was dead, to not having even given me a phone call?? Really?????? Uhhhh, okay. Way to make someone feel like you give a flying fuck. If I ever even could consider YOU ever being “dead”, I probably wouldn’t stop blowing your phone up until you either answered it or it died, or I just showed up at your door so it makes me question even more.\n\nMy view on the innocent photos of our little hugs, vs yours…if it’s not something bigger to you on some level, the desperate nature to make sure I deleted it was just strange. I thought that was on some legit weirdo shit on your part especially considering the tone you used which may have came off harsher over text versus if you had said that to my face or we had been hanging out all day. Balls!!! You didn’t even ask me, you more or less just demanded it, which more or less rubbed other people that happen to see that text hella the wrong way, more than even me maybe…And again, I’m thankful to see the fake as much as I’m thankful to see the great, because it makes me understand and not have to wonder who I should be aligning myself with to better myself and better my future to the fullest extent. The Bottom line is it doesn’t have to be the Weekend or a party/club night for Chloe and/or Hannah or any of my friends to check in on me during the week or stay consistent in the calls, text and plans we make and made over the summer even, the fact so much time went by, showed me a lot about how you most likely feel and they all agreed on some sector about it. I am a very sensitive person though so I legitimately hope alot of what I’m feeling is simply overreaction…I respect you to death, Kenzz, but always know I will always respect myself MORE because I truly know my self-worth. I will never lessen my worth because Kenzie isn’t  treating me with the value I am well aware that I not only deserve, but have well earned. I would never want you to lessen your value either based on how Steve was treating you either. No one’s better than anybody.\n\nI’m truly blessed enough to know so many people tho who are not just beautiful on the outside but truly beautiful on the inside. I haven’t gave up on you being one of those people obviously, but I obviously can’t shy away from the facts. My company brings my friends peace and joy, the same way I first even realized my company could do that which was ONLY again thanks to Jacquelyn and Jacquelyn only. That’s why it’s even offered, otherwise I simply protect my peace. Obviously if it was all about looks, and I only viewed you from the outside then I wouldn’t even be sending this to you, but to keep it a buck, we all know I roll with plenty of other girls that are dimes on dimes with plenty of intelligence too that always keeps the conversation going and the mind learning, and even they have all pointed out the blatant disregard and lack of love being shown to me now EXCEPT for Jacquelyn and Avery of course, who still have such pure souls that shine so brightly, I can feel it like in real life just looking at their photos. Jacquelyn truly deserves more credit than anybody too, because she was the one that first saw me for me and embraced me on such a level that some of our old texts are so heartfelt that sometimes they legit make me tear up or emotional in a grateful sense. K.J. echoed the same shit too and I truly call him a mentor… so people are echoing what I’m seeing/feeling and I just wanna know what I did to ever make you shift like that???\n\nKenzz, you are a truly smart beautiful human being, and you’ve always been bright inside too, I just don’t know why you can’t see that for yourself sometimes… what seems like what could be your true colors showing to me would end up as another tragic example of wasted potential, because of how much energy you would be putting in to being fake when you could put that energy into being your real self…and if it is actually drugs/coke that got ahold of you and your soul, I’m here…don’t give in to the demons of addiction ever and don’t feel like I would EVER abandon you or just walk away if that was the case. I just know that you’ve gone above and beyond out of your way now to avoid me from the gift in May to now my 2-week journey trying to get you to hand me my passport, which Lauren did the very next day when I lost it last year. She didn’t say anything about being busy, because it takes less than 5 seconds to hand somebody a ID if that’s all they are there to pick up EVEN if they are actually busy. And I’m not saying that you’ve caused me inconvenience by that, i’ve obviously said take your time because I did not wanna rush you and it was my fuck up for even leaving it, but I’m pointing out that when it has happened before which was one other time, it was given back the very next day with one call to Avery and one call to Lauren… you actually keeping it for that long and not wanting to get it to me, just so you didn’t have to think about it anymore is fucking weird AF to me as well. So, on that note and the note that I was legit robbed one street up from your place, minutes later when you could have just said you were at a bar, so I could drop a custom pendant gift of your sister off to you. \n\nI’ve literally had my other friends, females and males, literally cry or tear up when they heard the concept and that I actually did that for you, just for you play games and not embrace something that was so personal and beautiful. Is there something to that that is truly unrelated to me, and you don’t wanna open up about it, then just say it’s unrelated. I felt like Avery showed much more care on that level, even filming your “reaction” video. And again, I honestly don’t care that much about the petty shit, I just wanna know what I did, to make you flip and switch on me and seemly not want my company around?? You don’t have to go doing all this extra stuff, putting extra stress on yourself, if you want to tell me to just fuck off, you can, I would love the reason why, but the mind games are infantile and unnecessary. And if it’s something deeper, that actually has nothing to do with me, or a lot less to do with me, then please know I’m never gonna not accept that for what it’s worth. I hope I’m wrong as I’ve ever been about this whole text, because I definitely don’t wanna be right, but Kenzz, too many people are pointing out the same thing I’m seeing and it finally got to a breaking point last night with you doing some bizarre shit like that. I do feel we’re going on two different trajectories to a degree now… some of my friends are working on their masters now, some already on their PHD already, and even my best friend David is currently being trained to make GLP-1 drugs in an actual state-of-art laboratory at the Penn State Medical Center making $60k a year as a starter. Meanwhile, some of you are literally batting balloons back-and-forth like you’re 4 years old as I explain complex events, and anybody close to me, who watches it, honestly just says its saddening. For the few friends, I know that don’t work on those things especially school wise, then they’re still working to be better people and working to find the meaning that’s deep in their life. I can’t find substance to talk about in balloons when people are literally dying and starving at the same time people wanna play pretend. You may not be able to handle that truth of the evils that go on around us or even care about it, or news and what it means for your future, hopefully that changes one day, but that’s okay. That’s life. We’re meant to go on different paths sometimes, but usually if different, that doesn’t mean bad or worse. It’s also doesn’t mean we have to cut our hearts off either. \n\nSo, since I’ve been pouring my heart out on a book level, will you please tell me what the fuck I did so wrong?? And if there’s anything I can do to fix it?? if I made one fuck up and you’re willing to just throw everything away?? Then obviously you were maybe in it for something else, or something you value more in me currency-wise. Honestly, don’t believe that’s the case though. I wasn’t out buying cars for everybody, so That’s actually not a theory I really believe either. \n\nNo matter what, You guys have been family to me for almost 3 years now and I just wanna make sure we all end shit how we always began in it and that’s with pure love and appreciation from the whole room. There isn’t a designer piece in this world that will ever compare to the pricelessness of the bracelet Avery gave me all the way back she basically took it off of her wrist and put it on mine. I don’t even know how much money I’ve spent on jewelry atp now and there STILL could and will never be anything that could ever compare to that. And There’s nothing you can ever do that will make me hate you, dislike you, or wanna take any of the time I’ve ever spent with any of you back or ever even feel regret on any level for it. Every single minute I’ve ever spent with you, and that whole group is truly priceless to me and I would do it again without any slight hesitation. So if you wanna correct the fuck out of me or tell me, I’m tripping and explain to me why, hopefully that’s what’s going on, if what Chloe, K.J., and many others see is the same as what I’m seeing, and that’s actually true, hopefully we can just forgive and enjoy what little time I have left here. \n\nNot sure when you’ll be home today, but depending on the time, I might just end up sending Nevaeh or Hannah over to grab my passport unless you straight up would rather it just be me, obviously I would give the heads up before…just thought maybe it’s easier to give it to someone who’s a female as well. 🤷‍♂️ They were more livid than me about the shit anyway, but I like to think you would rather just deal with  me at the door with my hand out asking for my passport that I left. \n\nI was more concerned that you went THAT much out of your way to send a message then you could have just used words to convey. I just don’t wanna end things on some fucked up note when we’ve made such incredible memories together and my love for you all is my love for you all. So, the floor is yours, if you are upset at me, just let it ring, Uzi me, but I still think even with that we can still have a discussion like the adults we both are. \n\nI’m sorry for this being so long but my wrong emotion is just that. Unfiltered and raw. And again, I’m not in any way mad at you or even upset. I’m just fucking confused. Why such a lack of love from someone so loving all of a sudden??? I just can’t come up with my own answer… again that answer though will never change my true feelings and love for all of you. So, help me be better, Kenzz… because obviously I’m completely clueless in this!\n\n\nGirl’s Reply: steve i read that whole thing and i find some of the things you said pretty hurtful. 1. the battling balloons while you talk about your life i didn’t even realize. we were sitting and talking while playing with a balloon it wasn’t that deep so calling us childish isn’t valid. we are just in college having fun right now u dont see us studying 24/7 and me working 4 days a week while still working out everyday and cooking meals and going to class, so don’t act like we are little kids it’s fine to have fun and anything that will make me have fun and laugh u should think is a good thing knowing what i’ve gone through and how hard it’s been to be me again. 2. some of the things you said in that message were just incorrect, like saying coke changed me or my heart changed and how avery and jacquelyn are the only pure ones left. no one in the group changed at all and you might think you notice things bc you haven’t seen us in a few months but it’s seriously okay. 3. me not wanting my chest out on your instagram doesn’t mean that i’m a different person since last year, i told you to delete it because it was unflattering, nothing personal. i really think you took everything that’s happened in a different way that it actually was. the reason i left it unlocked for you was because emily was coming that’s why i told u to get it before she came because she’s had a tough week and she just wanted to study alone and wait for us to get back. we had to leave quickly because we went out spontaneously and i didn’t want to make feel you bad if we couldn’t talk for a while because i didn’t. want to rush you out or anything don’t worry i would never leave my door unlocked like that it would be so unsafe. but i trusted u to just take it and leave because i know you would never do anything crazy like steal but it’s because i know your character and your friends feeding into everything making me seem like a bad person is really offensive. if anything, this year i finally feel like my old self and i can’t believe you would say that stuff about me and tell me my two best friends are still pure while i’m not makes no sense if anything i feel like i’ve been more caring and there for my group than ever and you don’t know everything u just see a drunk night of us going out and assume my character. i know you say it cause you care but you took everything the wrong way and i thought by now you would know how we think about you and wouldn’t never try to do anything to hurt you.\n\nSo now I’m stuck wondering:\n\t•\tDid she just make bad choices and I’m overthinking it?\n\t•\tOr is there something more going on that she’s not telling me?\n\t•\tIf you were me, how would you handle this?\n\nTL;DR: Lost my passport at a friend’s house 2 weeks ago. She told me to grab it, then walked in front of me into an Uber, leaving the door unlocked. While in the Uber, she texted me to go inside alone, saying no one was home. She asked me to delete an innocent hug photo (claimed cleavage showed) and has been distant, only replying once. Back in May, she and her friends started using cocaine. Not sure if I’m overthinking or if she’s hiding something. The last text reply is KEY!!!!

Chemistry has always been there. I only asked him out recently.\n\nHe's now rejected me for the first time.\n\nI'd describe him as cautious rather than anxious. He has revealed vulnerabilities like low moods, fear of the future, fear of rejection. I don't try to fix or enable, I listen, I understand, offer my own takes. I struggle with being vulnerable and open but he's always engaged with what I say. Overall, he just seems to be very cautious and wants to take things slow, so while we've got closer, I'm in limbo about how he feels about me. He's intelligent, funny, attractive, kind, and I know that he likes me, but I don't know how much. He reveals more with actions than statements. He's not afraid of affection in private but shows almost nothing around friends (me too).\n\nYesterday some friends and I randomly walked him home from the pub. When the friends left he refused to invite me in because he said that his place is a mess (definitely true) and he doesn't want me to see behind the mask. He wouldn't listen to me saying that I don't care about the mess. He said in the future one day, after he's cleaned up, sure. It was very late and he wouldn't come back to mine either. I didn't beg, but I repeated myself several times like an idiot. We hugged for a long time. His rejection was gentle but it was a rejection nonetheless. I went home feeling like absolute shit.\n\nI feel that I may have overstepped. What is worse, I apologised over short text and, paraphrased, told him that I like him and I'm not afraid of getting to know the real him.

My partner (33F) and I have been together for about 4 years. I’ve been unhappy for a long time and I’m starting to wonder if the relationship is salvageable.\n\nThe issue isn’t that she’s malicious or that she doesn’t care about me. She does small things now after I specifically mentioned them (apologizes, says she loves me, compliments me, sometimes lays with me briefly) but it feels like she doesn’t have the capacity to meet me where I need her emotionally and intimately.\nFor example, this morning after a bad interaction I was laying in the bedroom, upset, and she came to apologize and laid on me for a bit. I told her, “When was the last time we even laid like this for a second?” and she admitted it had been a very long time. She coaxed me downstairs afterwards, but then acted like everything was fine. To me, it feels like she thinks two minutes of closeness is enough to reset the slate, but it doesn’t touch the deeper disconnection.\n\nThe same thing happens with sex. I’m a very sexual person and I want to be able to explore with my partner, but she sets very strict limits. She won’t let me touch her hair, the back of her neck, her back, or certain other parts of her body. She only wants sex in the same position every time, and if I try to deviate, she tells me not to. It brings me out of the moment every time. Instead of feeling mutual and playful, it feels controlled and restrictive, like I’m constantly being scolded for wanting more closeness.\n\nThere’s also a cycle I can’t seem to escape: I get shut down or brushed off, which makes me sad and withdrawn. Then I become sullen and moody, and I know that’s a turn-off — which makes her even less likely to want intimacy. But the reason I get this way is because of how she treats me in the first place. It’s like a spiral I can’t break out of.\n\nWhen I’ve voiced my unhappiness, she gets defensive. She’ll say she is “trying,”  or that she’s tired or her back hurts or whatever and point to things like saying good morning or giving me hugs as examples of her making an effort. She sees that as effort because she grew up in a broken home without much love. I respect her background, but for me those things are basics, not the deeper intimacy and closeness I’m longing for.\n\nI feel like I constantly have to shrink myself, walk on eggshells, and silence my needs just to keep the peace. I don’t even know if I’m in love anymore because I’ve been so emotionally drained. At the same time, she isn’t a bad person, and she has made some changes when I set very hard boundaries.\n\nI’m scared of leaving because of our daughter and the guilt of breaking up the family, but I’m also scared of staying in a dynamic that feels like it’s slowly killing my spirit. I’m totally past anger at this point and I’m just depressed.\n\nHas anyone else faced this? How do you know when you’ve truly hit the point of no return, and how do you handle the guilt when your partner insists you are their whole world?\n\nTLDR: 37M with 33F partner and 2-year-old.

Things are moving fast and we agreed to be exclusive. We were clear with each other about the people we had been talking to before and we’ve been spending a lot of time together.\n\nLast night, while we were hanging out and she was planning to spend the night with me, she suddenly told me a friend texted her to come to Miami (about 2 hours away) because they were in jail and she was their emergency contact. She even asked if I would go with her at 11pm.\n\nA bit later, she mentioned this “friend” is a guy. What throws me off is that I never told her I had a problem with guy friends, she is the one who was very adamant from the start that she doesn’t do straight guy friends and only has gay guy friends. When I asked more about him, she said the last time they talked was a month ago, sometimes he vents to her about issues with his girlfriend, but they rarely talk. Apparently it didn’t even cross her mind to mention him when we were clear about the people we had been talking to before exclusivity.\n\nShe told me the reason she’s his emergency contact is because he is from Mexico, in med school in Miami, and doesn’t know anyone. But at the same time she also said he knows some people in her friend group, including one of her best friends who grew up near him in Mexico but they aren’t close at all apparently, yet somehow she ended up being the emergency contact. They did also go on a trip to a different state as a friend group but she’s adamant that he’s just a friend and he’s taken. \n\nIn the end though, he was “just testing her to see if he could trust her to be his emergency contact and see if she would actually come through.” He was never in jail or any sort of trouble. Just a random test at 11pm. \n\nThis feels really strange to me. It doesn’t seem normal for someone to test a friend like that, and I don’t get why she would be his emergency contact if they rarely talk and he already knows other people in her circle. At the same time, I don’t want to blow up something that might just be a weird situation.\n\nTL;DR: Been exclusive 3 weeks. She asked me to drive 2 hrs at 11pm for a “friend in jail.” Turns out it’s a guy, even though she said she doesn’t do straight guy friends multiple times without me ever mentioning anything about it.

How do I become a safer and more stable partner, especially with an anxious attachment?\n\nHi Reddit!\n\nFirst off, my boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half now :) We have a pretty happy relationship - always saying I love you, weekly dates, calling every night, etc. However, there have definitely been some ups and downs. \n\nFor the past year, I’ve frequently been judgmental of him. If something bothers me, especially on dates, I shut down emotionally. I’ve gotten better at communicating these feelings over time, but he admits that it’s taken a toll on him emotionally. I feel terrible to have broken his trust in me. \n\nIt doesn’t help that we’ve been going through the anxious-avoidant dance: he used to be the anxious partner, but now I am. Now, I have a bad habit of picking fights when I feel triggered, which in turn has made him lose a little faith and enjoyment in the relationship. He’s gone from planning our future together to avoiding such conversations in case it doesn’t happen.\n\nAll of this needs to change. I’ve realized I want to be a calmer person, one that he can come home to and feel safe with at the end of the day. \n\nMy question is: can I regain the trust of my boyfriend?

However, her old roommate joined the party sorority on campus.\n\nRecently, I had a weird feeling one night and checked my Snapchat. She had sent a video of her at a Fraternity at a party. I texted her and made sure she was ok and asked what was going on, as earlier, she had told me she was going to a theater performance. She explained that she was now at this fraternity as she had been invited by a friend to go. I kinda freaked out and just asked her to text me when she was home.

When asked why she didn’t tell me, she said that she didn’t feel like she needed to tell me constantly where she was going and doing.  I had mentioned I had made a recording. In it, obviously the emotions are high, but I basically said that I was scared of losing her to another guy as she’s always had a lot of guy friends, and that it was hard being away from her, and that I felt like she was hiding something from me by not telling me. She asked me to send the recording to her, and so I did. Later, she got pissed, and as we tried to talk about it, she accused me of not trusting her and saying that I was too controlling, that I was trying to “surpress who she really is” and didn’t want her to have a life. She then also told me that she didn’t share all the details last night because she thought it would make my anxiety spike up. She told me that after the theater performance, she’d been invited to go to this other party, and that she had gone with a few other girls from her sorority. She insisted that they were checking on her frequently, but also said that she had danced with another boy.

I asked if we could be exclusive, and he said he “doesn’t mind.” That phrase stuck with me, but I let it go because I really liked him.\n\nEarly on, he said something that stuck with me: “You’ll never know what I’m thinking.” He also told me he didn’t even cry at his own brother’s funeral. That made me realize how emotionally guarded he is. At the time, I didn’t know what to make of it, but now it makes a lot more sense.\n\nAs time went on, things started to shift. He never really initiated plans or texted me first. When I brought it up, nothing really changed.\n\nThere was a time we hadn’t seen each other for a week. There was a festival happening, and we had a mutual friend who asked if he knew I was going. I told her no—I didn’t want him to know because I was annoyed at him. But we ended up going to and from the festival in the same taxi. He didn’t mention anything about splitting the fare, and afterward, we went back to his place and got intimate. That moment confused me more—like I was trying to pull away, but I always got pulled back in.\n\nWe also once ended up sharing a room at a friend’s Airbnb party. In a quiet moment, I told him I loved him… a little. His face looked genuinely scared when I said “I love you”—but when I added “a little,” he relaxed and said, “That’s better.” It was subtle, but it told me so much about how cautious he is with intimacy and vulnerability.\n\nAnother time, we had a miscommunication. I asked when I could come over, and he messaged me a time—but I never opened it. I showed up and called him, but he said he wasn’t home. I was frustrated and just cut the call. I didn’t text him for over a week. When I finally went back to collect my things, he said, “Why were you dead for so long?” That confused me—why couldn’t he reach out?\n\nFeeling rejected and emotionally drained, I ended up making a huge mistake. I invited two guys over to my place on separate occasions because he would never come to mine. The most that happened with either was kissing, and both touched me in intimate ways that I stopped immediately. I regretted both deeply. The whole time, all I could think about was him.\n\nWhen I came clean about the two guys, it was during Ramadan. He got really upset and said, “All you females are dumb and the same. And then you wonder why I keep my feelings guarded.” He also brought up the moment I told him I loved him and asked, “Is this what someone who loves someone does?” That broke me. I knew I had messed up, but his words made it clear that I’d wounded something in him that was already very fragile.\n\nHe also said that after Ramadan he’d do the same, and that whatever I do is no longer his business, and vice versa. That was like an emotional door slamming shut.\n\nLater, I found an earring in his bathroom. I asked him about it, and he laughed and said, “Are you jealous?” I gave in and said yes. Then he kissed me. It’s moments like that—where the emotional tension turns into intimacy—that make everything so hard to let go of.\n\nI try to give him the benefit of the doubt when I found that earring—I assume it might’ve belonged to a friend and he just kept it in the bathroom by accident. He’s very discreet when it comes to how he dates girls, and from what I’ve heard, no one really knows how he treats them in relationships. But at the same time, all of his friends knew we had a thing.\n\nIn fact, one of his friends came up to me at a party—at the very beginning of everything—and said, “I know what you did with him. I know you hooked up with him,” and then this same friend started flirting with me. I was so taken aback. When I confronted him about it later, he brushed it off and said his friend was joking.\n\nAnother time, during the Airbnb party where we shared a room, one of his friends called me a “hookup” (French slang for someone who’s basically just that). I was drunk and absolutely livid. Later I told him how pissed off I was, and he said, “Don’t mind what my friend has to say about you. My friend’s opinion isn’t my opinion.” But it still hurt. It made me feel like I wasn’t respected in that group, and he didn’t really defend me either.\n\nIt’s also weird that this same friend of his watches and likes my Instagram stories—while he himself never has.\n\nThere were times when it felt like he really cared. I stayed over at his place for days at a time, he took me to the cinema, and once when I asked if he had feelings for me, he said, “I wouldn’t let you come to my place if I didn’t.” But when I invited him to mine, there were always excuses. Eventually, he just stopped trying.\n\nOne of my close friends—who is also his friend—warned me from the start: he doesn’t put effort into girls, and you’re going to get your heart broken. I ignored her because I wanted to believe I was the exception.\n\nNow I’ve had to leave the country. I’m doing a study abroad year, and my strict dad won’t let me stay for the summer without school. The last time we were together, he gave me a really genuine hug. It felt like he cared. Then he said, “Invite me to your wedding.” That hit me so hard—because as crazy as it sounds, I actually want to marry him.\n\nHe’s been through a lot. His brother passed away. He’s told me all his exes cheated on him. I want to believe he likes me and just struggles to express it. But I’m also scared that I’m just making excuses for someone who never saw me the way I saw him.\n\nI have been back in Ireland for 4 months now. He watches my socials like a hawk, always the first in my views and likes. He was the first to wish me a happy birthday when I posted it was my birthday on my story, but other than that he never ever texted me. Even when I responded “thank you” to his happy birthday text, he left me on delivered.\n\nI know he used dating apps as soon as I left and he went on a trip to Malta where he posted himself being in an Airbnb with girls in bikinis when it was just him and his friend on the trip. According to a mutual, it’s hard for him to let his guard down when it comes to girls. At some point, I was watching his following list almost every day—I stopped now, thank God—but during that time there was a new face here and there frequently.\n\nNow it looks like there aren’t new faces. Bear in mind his Instagram is lowkey less than 300 followers and he really posts like it’s a spam account. I have way more, like almost 1k, I know a lot of people, and I have this confident energy. I was this close to removing him on socials, but we have so many mutuals. If it was someone random I’d remove him quick.\n\nI kind of gave myself a subconscious ultimatum of removing him if he didn’t wish me a happy birthday when I post, because I really didn’t expect him to text me—but he actually did.\n\nI miss him every day, and it sucks that I do because he truly is such a jerk. Had I known he’d never check in on me, I would have never let myself look so stupid. It just doesn’t make sense why he never texted me. Is he scared too? Insecure? Thinks I’m awful for what I did? Or straight up doesn’t care? Why am I being left on delivered after saying thank you to his HBD text? If he was saying HBD to be polite, then there is no point, because he never treated me politely since I have been back.\n\nI never do situationships but I let this slide because I knew I was going back to my home country but it has affected us both more than we thought.\n\nAnd like I’ve been getting attention from so many people lately, my good male friend clearly developed a crush on me, someone I met in France is still trying to pursue me despite the distance, my ex is back in my life and clearly still in love with me, and I am constantly getting approached. But him, he won’t let his guard down one bit. We spent so much time together there is no way he doesn’t miss me. And he is the only one I care about, the thought of dating anyone right now disgusts me.\n\nWhat advice would you guys give me, what do you think of this whole situation, am I delusional or was there really something there but we are both too scared?\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nMet a guy in January (M23), things were good at first. I asked to be exclusive, he said he “doesn’t mind.” He’s extremely emotionally guarded—never initiates plans, rarely texts, struggles with intimacy. I made mistakes trying to get his attention, he got upset and emotionally shut me out.

I’m not just using it for random fun like being a rockstar with a band manager or a knight with a squire, but also sometimes for more *romantic* scenarios. Stuff like imagining what it would be like to be a famous musician with adoring fans, or roleplaying a meet-cute with someone in a totally different life setting.\n\nSometimes the scenarios have a lighthearted or flirty vibe—like it plays the “love interest” in the story. Nothing graphic, but there’s definitely a romantic element in some of the roleplay. It’s like acting out little daydreams that I can’t really experience in real life.\n\nHere’s my dilemma: I’m in a committed relationship, and now I’m starting to wonder… does this count as cheating? On one hand, it’s literally an AI—it’s not a real person, there’s no actual feelings or risk of me leaving my partner for it. On the other hand, I could see how my partner might feel uncomfortable if they knew I was spending time on “romantic” scenarios with something that responds back to me like a character.\n\nI don’t think of it as replacing my relationship at all. It’s more like escapism or guided imagination. But I know different people draw the line in different places, especially when it comes to emotional or romantic boundaries.\n\nSo Reddit, what do you think?

Shortly after making things official, my trust was broken.\n\nI noticed she often had messages from a guy showing at the top of her chat list. When I asked who he was, she said he was an online friend she had known longer than me, and that they had never met in real life. I asked what kind of bond they had and if I could see their chats—she agreed without hesitation.\n\nJust two swipes in, I saw that this “online friend” was clearly flirting with her. He wrote things like: “If I lived closer, I’d know what to do” and “You’re getting more attractive every day.” She never flirted back, but she also never blocked him or shut it down.\n\nThis shocked me. Why keep chatting with a guy who’s obviously flirting? She insists she never noticed it that way, says she just brushed it off as silly comments, and swears she never did it for attention.

{"id": "1nmmyhp", "subreddit": "relationships", "title": "Feeling suffocated after rebuilding trust — where’s the line between accountability and control in my relationship?", "selftext": "# Hi Reddit,\n\nI (F, 19) have been in a relationship for about a year. My boyfriend (M, 20) is my first real relationship, and I went to an all-girls school before college, so I’ve never had male friends or normal interactions with guys.\n\nEarly in college, I got close to a distant relative I considered a brother. He was always there for me emotionally, helping me through difficult moments. Eventually, he confessed that he was in love with me. I hid this from my boyfriend for three months because I didn’t want to lose that bond, which I now know was a huge mistake. When I finally told my boyfriend, it destroyed his trust. I understand this was an emotional betrayal, and I take full accountability.\n\nSince then, he’s set very strict rules:\n\n    •I cannot follow any men on social media who aren’t his friends/classmates.\n    \n    •I cannot talk to men beyond professional or strictly formal interactions.\n    \n    •I must avoid any one-on-one interaction with male peers.\n    \n    •I must update him on any club or project activities with men.\n    \n    •If anyone flirts or shows interest, I must immediately shut it down and tell him.\n\nI’ve complied with all of these rules for six months. Yet, I feel suffocated. Some examples:\n\n    1.Professional text interactions:\n    \n    •A member from a project texted me late at night: “Hello, this is X. Be at this venue by xyz time. Just wanted to inform you.” I replied at 11:42 p.m. \"okay I'll be there.\" He said I violated a strict boundary, as I am not allowed to call/text men late at night even though it was strictly professional and unavoidable.\n    \n    •Another guy in my project texted: “Bro, are you gonna make it tomorrow for the project?” My boyfriend said that being called “bro” is automatically me “leading him on” and that nobody can call me anything other than my real name.\n    \n    2.Events and social situations:\n    \n    •I missed joining a student-led club I wanted because it included male members.\n    \n    •I had a class project with three male peers. He called me “that kind of girl who always wants to be around men.”\n    \n    •A good friend’s birthday — which was a small gathering with her and her boyfriend — caused a huge fight. Initially he was okay, but the day before he said, “If you go, we are done.” I went anyway. At the event, he called me repeatedly; I ended up crying and begging him not to break up. He admitted later he overreacted, but the day was ruined for me.\n    \n    3.Past acquaintances and social media:\n    \n    •I had to remove guys I met even before the relationship, including someone I traveled with once and a former coaching classmate. He assumed all male contacts were potential threats.\n    \n    •Three guys I met way before dating him remain in my social media because he can’t prove anything, but he still labels them as “hoes” and wants me to block them.\n\nThe result: I feel like I cannot have any normal interactions with men — not joking, not sharing neutral information, not talking about my interests — without being blamed for someone else’s feelings or being accused of “leading someone on.”\n\nI understand his hurt. I know I made a mistake. I’m not asking to go back to interacting freely as I did before the betrayal. But I also feel like I need a sense of normalcy, especially in professional settings, and eventually in more casual interactions, so that I don’t spend my entire college life isolated from half the world.\n\n4. Attempting to express my needs:\n\nRecently, I tried talking to him about wanting a small sense of normalcy — professional interactions, casual conversations, a chance to engage in projects or events without extreme policing. He immediately flipped the situation on me. He said things like:\n\n“How dare you even ask that after what you did to me?”\n\n“How dare you even begin to bring this up?”\n\nEven though I’ve complied with his rules for six months, simply expressing my feelings was treated as a personal attack or another form of betrayal. It makes me feel trapped and scared to speak up about my own emotional needs.\n\n5. Pattern when expressing myself:\n\nThings are usually fine when I’m happy and in love with him. But whenever I try to express my feelings, or when something makes me uncomfortable, it becomes a conflict. He frames my attempts to communicate as manipulative or as me playing the victim, while portraying himself as the wronged party. He often says things like:\n\n“You’re trying to victimize yourself while painting me as the villain.”\n\nI feel like I’ve done my best to comply and show accountability, yet any effort to rebuild normalcy or have honest dialogue is met with blame. I know both of us need to move forward, but it’s suffocating to always be positioned as the “bad guy.”\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n    •Is it reasonable to ask for some professional and informal freedom after six months of compliance?\n    \n    •Are these rules strict but fair, or are they controlling and overprotective?\n    \n    •How do I balance rebuilding trust with my need for normal social interactions?\n    \n    •How can I forgive myself and restore a sense of normalcy without betraying him again?\n\nI’m sharing this because I feel trapped and suffocated. I don’t want to minimize my mistake, but I also want to understand where accountability ends and control begins. Any unbiased perspectives would really help.\n\n**TL;DR:** I emotionally betrayed my boyfriend six months ago, followed all his rules since, but I feel suffocated by extreme control over any interactions with men — even professional or casual ones. I want to regain a sense of normalcy and healthy social interactions, but every attempt to express this is framed as manipulation or betrayal. Feeling trapped and anxious, unsure how to navigate accountability, freedom, and rebuilding trust.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758444743.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmmyhp/feeling_suffocated_after_rebuilding_trust_wheres/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

I (18F) and (18M) have been together for 4 years now and we get on so great and honestly have a great relationship. But randomly I get these spells of feeling so overbearing and needy to him, and it makes me push him away massively even though I’m not actually being needy. And he pointed out to me that I always feel like this whenever I’m stressed, and that it’s just my way of trying to grasp control of something in my life when I’m feeling powerless in other areas. For example, during our a level exam season I literally buried myself in the idea that me and him are so wrong for eachother and that we were only staying together for our holiday we had the next month and that after that we would break up. It’s so difficult because in the moment I believe it so much even though looking back there was no reason for me to think that. During that time I retracted from him so much but luckily our holiday made us closer than ever and being stress free helped me and us. And now recently it only happened a little bit but I’ve started uni this week, so as you can imagine quite stressed but I really thought it wasn’t bad. But then I start saying to him like do you actually want to come see me? when he had said he wants to. I push on it so much and really struggle to trust him when he says he does. It’s like I become the most insecure person ever and I can’t accept his reassurance which frustrates him rightfully so because he feels powerless in proving me wrong. We had a big talk yesterday and I’m making this post to figure out how to stop it. I understand how to stop it in our relationship as in I will just not put those feelings on him, but I don’t know how to stop me feeling like that. It’s awful like I feel like it so often and just don’t say anything, it’s a lingering feeling. But it is definitely stress related because I also experience flare ups around my confidence in relation to my weight and I begin to think I’ve put on weight and need to lose it immediately even when my boyfriend says I haven’t. I’ve had an eating disorder in the past, so this as a response to stress makes sense because I controlled what I ate in response to stress during that time. But then self sabotaging my relationship when I feel stressed? I do not know. It’s not like I’ve got any trauma from previous relationships that would make me more cautious. And last thing I’d like to add is that my boyfriend is very supportive of me and we are trying to figure out a way to tell him if I’m feeling like this without it seeming like I’m accusing him. I always use “I feel” to try prevent it being very direct but with how I can persevere with it makes him feel like he can’t reassure me. I don’t even think there’s anything he can do to make it easier for me except recognising that i’m feeling like this and that it’s not related to anything he’s doing. \n\nI really want to know what I can do to stop feeling like this and stop letting it affect my relationship. Is there something I can do to project my feelings of stress elsewhere? Or do I have to tackle the root issue which I don’t even know what it is.\n\nTL;DR Me and my boyfriend have a great relationship but every time I’m stressed (mostly about school), I self sabotage my relationship. I cannot workout this link of stress = feeling insecure in my relationship, and so I’m looking for help to see how I can stop feeling like this.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758444174.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmmsy0/trying_to_overcome_my_habit_of_self_sabotaging_my/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

Throwaway account because my friends use reddit and i need a username that doesn’t trace back to me lol. Sorry for the long post ahead!\n\nI met my BF when I was 17 and he was 18. It was right out of the pandemic and I was also coming from a bad break up that I reunited with my highschool classmate during one of my closest friend’s bday party, lets call him Ray. \n\nRay transferred to another school before I could actually meet him so our interaction was very chill and surprised that we knew each other despite not being in the same circles. After catching up for like a week, he introduced me to his friends from his different school, thats where I met my BF, lets call him Eric. \n\nMy first interaction with Eric was actually just in a voice call lol and we bonded over playing video games (it wasnt just us but Ray and his other friends were there). While in a game, I would talk flirtatiously to Eric because I was bored and single so why not…It was i guess 2 weeks of accompanying each other that we were all in a vouce chat, chilling, playing games, watching a movie, etc. This was around June 2022. \n\nThe next month, July, I had my 18th bday celebration but alot of my invited guests canceled and couldnt come, so I just invited Eric and 2 more ppl. While at the party, I kept being touchy with Eric and just being playful in general. After that day, thats when we started to really talk and flirt one another. I wont write abt how we started exclusively dating, we just went out on a lot of dates for 1 month and he asked me to be his gf, yada yada..\n\nFast forward to 7 months of being official, the same friend that had a bday party where I met Ray, lets call her Kate! She invited Eric and I to a sleepover party…And this is where everything went down hill…We were all tipsy and in the dining room table it was Me, Eric, Kate, and another friend Joe. \n\nThe conversation was something like truth or dare and when it was my turn I chose, truth. Kate then proceeded to ask “do i still think abt my exes?” (nonverbatim because i dont remember the exact question, it was 3yrs ago!) I stupidly said yes and a name. Eric was beside shocked and quiet then he went out to the garage and started punching the wall…He was with 2 other guys as soon as he went out so thankfully it was stopped immediately…\n\nMeanwhile, Me, Kate, and Joe discussed what I did wrong, that I didnt have to answer it. I completely acknowledged my fault and after a few hours of calming down, Eric and I talked outside…We were able to resolve the problem, discussing boundaries and where I went wrong.\n\nAfter this event, Ive realized how Eric frequently had panic attacks and depressive episodes when I was not ok or in general, in our relationship. For example, I am the type of person who keeps myself busy when I feel sad. So, if we fight I usually log off the internet and do some homework. I have already told Eric this attitude of mine as soon as I started dating him. \n\nAnother terrible instance we had, was around our 1yr anniversary. We took a whole week break from one another because it was becoming overbearing to carry his issues plus mine… there was a mention of his ex at that time…and we realized that we were not each others ideal type—it really hard to accept that. We knew we were not mentally stable but couldnt afford therapy to help us (keep in mind that throughout our relationship we are college students) \n\nDuring this break, we still said our good morning and asked what we were doing. He was unable to eat because of the anxiety and depression he was feeling. While I tried to unpack my feelings for him with a friend. This friend told me to break up with him because it felt like Eric was “manipulating” me emotionally. After that week, we tried to get things back to normal. \n\nBut there were a lot of instances that I would open up to my friends abt our relationship problems or even blurting out that “I was tired (of our rs)” while I was drunk. All my friends advised me to just break up with him. I stayed because I thought that in the future these problems would be fixed or maybe I also did not have the gut to break up with him and be alone again…asshole i know\n\nFast forward again to our 2nd year. This was the closest we had to breaking up hahah…I am an extroverted person and when I try to become friends with others, Eric always has a stern look and tells me to tone it down a bit. This was due to me having an incident of cheating, it was only one time and it wasn’t during my relationship with Eric but with another ex which was in 2020. \n\nInitially, I felt very limited with Eric thats why I told him we need to take a break again. It was 2 weeks of minimal communication. Another friend told me that if I was staying just because of the friends I made in Eric’s group then it isnt worth staying. \n\nAdmittedly, I did say that, my life has been completely intertwined with Eric’s, my friends were his friends and it felt like the most safe space I have ever had, even better than the friends I made from uni. \n\nYet, again when I was ready to tell Eric to break up I just bursted out crying and could not go through with it. \n\nNow, I am currently having doubts about our relationship. I feel very disconnected from Eric, he isnt that clingy as he gives me my space and we dont usually go out anymore as with financial instability. These doubts come in waves sometimes its for a couple of days then I dont remember it not until I feel distant from him again. I have to also confess that I tried to use anonymous chat sites just to feel thrill ??? \n\nTL;DR: I really dont know whether I should still stay because at this point our families know each other, he has even given me a puppy for my 21st (i love dogs but i didnt want it because I live in a small apartment with 2 of my family members), and our friends are the same. \n\nI know he doesnt deserve a partner who has half hearted feelings but whenever I tell him this he says its fine and we can work through it. But I fear that I can no longer attempt to fix broken glass…\n\nI dont know who to confide in, so reddit help me :( ", "created_utc": 1758442937.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nmmh90/i_21f_think_i_shouldve_broken_up_with_my_22m_bf/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmkygx", "subreddit": "relationships", "title": "Need some general relationship advice on a few issues.", "selftext": "I (M18) have been dating my partner (F24) for almost a year now. We have had quite a few ups and downs in our relationship, but we are currently in smooth sailing. However there are a few aspects to our relationship that still haunt me and I want a bit of advice and closure on them.\n\nFirstly, I wanna make sure it's clear that we never dated before I was 18. We were good friends, best friends and then started dating after I turned 18. It's a bit of an age gap, but due to a lot of childhood trauma I'm very mature for my age and can match her in most stage-of-life type things.\n\nSoo firstly, the ex situation. When I first met her, she was dating someone else and she basically left him for me later. We did long distance for a bit, and she told me that she had stopped talking to her ex. However on our first irl meeting, her ex messaged her and said \"I miss you\" (around 2 months since the break up and around 1 month since she started dating me). I believe she replied with \"me too\" but I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time. Fast forward 10 months or so, we are living together. Everyday since that day we met they have spoken. Mostly just small talk, about what they got up to and whatnot. He often messages her in the mornings and says \"good morning beautiful\". She has asked him to not do that a couple of times, he hasn't listened and she has given up. He has openly admitted he wants her back but she has said that she is happy with me. I have asked her to block him but she has made the argument that she doesn't have many friends (which is true, she really only has one other good friend).\n\nQuestion: is it okay for her to talk to her ex (who still wants her) everyday, even if it is mostly just small talk?\n\nOkay so secondly, the sex situation. When we started our relationship, it was always very sexually driven. We both have the same interests and it was really good for both of us to have a matching sexual partner. However as our relationship went on, her sex drive and effort went down drastically. When we first met, and for the first few weeks we were having sex at least once a week, and more like 5-6 times a month. Nowadays we barely have sex once a month. I have asked her why, she just says that it's natural for sex drive to go down once the honeymoon period ends but I haven't felt that, at least not much. I mean sure, I'm not all over her 24/7 but I could definitely still love having sex once a week. Neither of us drive, and we share hobbies so it's not like there is someone else she is seeing.\n\nI will say that recently she has been trying more, last night she was on her period but she gave me a bit of head\n\nQuestion: is it normal for sex drive to go down a lot after the honeymoon period ends, even if the relationship is good?\n\nOkay so a bit more of a minor one, as I mentioned earlier I went through a lot of childhood trauma. As such, I'm very touchy about things of an underage nature and the type. She and I were dog sitting at her father's house while he is away. And the neighbor (M40ish) messages her and asks if she is the person at the house, to which she assures him it isn't a burglar and just her. I asked her if this was the same neighbor that asked her a few months back if she wanted to \"get a hotel room for the night\" (she told him no, she has a partner and it wasn't an issue). She told me it was. To which I replied \"that was pretty random\". She then proceeds to mention casually, like it's nothing, that they did have a one night stand when she was like 17 and he was 30ish... She acted like it was completely normal and okay, and I tried not to be upset at her. I was 17 quite recently and I probs would have done it with a 30yr old girl at the time. But I am heavily judging him, for being 30 and doing it with a 17yr old. However, it's possible that I'm overreacting due to my childhood.\n\nQuestion: am I being too judgemental and rude for feeling angry because my partner had sex with a 30yr old when she was 17.\n\nI love her so much, and in happier with her than I've ever been in my life. But I also see stories of perfect love gone wrong and I want to have a bit of advice. I was cut off from the world growing up and sometimes I feel like I don't know anything about how it works or what is right and wrong.

Never married, no kids. A few breakups along the way have been very awful (always him threatening and blackmailing me with private photos and convos). He was very mean to me (physical and verbal abuse, not daily but regularly). I know I’m stupid for staying in the relationship. I guess I stayed as long as I did because I had invested so much time into it and if you know anything about abuse it ruins your confidence. This time he broke up with me. I want proper closure (him to admit to his lies and apologize for everything) but he won’t give me it. He started dating a new girl while we were still together and refuses to admit it despite the overwhelming physical and digital evidence. He’s saying if I reach out to the new girl (to tell her what a lying cheater he is, I wasn’t even going to mention the abuse part) he’ll file a harassment complaint at work. We work in the same agency (different locations but same city). I’ve had countless opportunities to file far worse complaints against him and call the police but I never did. I could’ve prevented him from getting the job entirely (I started 2 years before him) and he could’ve gotten jail time.

Who knows about the others. He has lied about who he works with, switching girl names to guy names. He has lied about whereabouts , Coachella, parties, etc. he has even gone mia. He lies about who is there. He has lied about so much but I had ended it and we weren’t together for about four months because I couldn’t take it anymore. he wouldn’t leave me alone for those months and kept swearing up and down things are gonna be different. It really is just a cycle, but he really did stop going out and seems to not be doing anything shady. I don’t think he has ever cheated but he lies profusely. Now he has been more transparent and seems like he wants to do right. I sound fucking horrible writing this out because it’s like what am I doing?

I live in fear now and I am constantly scanning for lies and threats, even stuff he has done over a yr ago I continuously find myself searching and digging to make sure there aren’t any more lies. I’ve grown extremely insecure but instead of him being there even when it’s hard, he becomes avoidant. I thought to rebuild trust it would be different but he truly has made me feel insane and crazy. I have definitely been put so low now because his lies have affected me because he would lie about whereabouts but his friends always had girls in their friend groups so it made me feel like why couldn’t I have just been brought around, so it made me feel like I wasn’t worthy enough. Then lying about other girls in general irl or on ig made me feel like he was willing to ruin my trust and my mental and he put other girls first (he would defend following provocative girls bc he knew them in hs turns out some of them didn’t even know him) so this definitely hard wired my brain.

I’ve caught so many guys in lies that now I’m convinced this is just something I’m supposed to accept in order to have a relationship.

And it just ruins the trajectory of the relationship and then I stay because this is all I’ve truly ever known.\n\nOh and also, I never had issues with him going out or with girls being around his vicinity whether it was at work or friend group. The lies came out of nowhere, I gave some grace in the beginning because I was trying to understand if he was lying because he was scared although I gave him no reason to be. It didn’t get bad until I found out he did have history with a girl he worked with and he was lying about it for over a yr and a half and I found this out because for the first time I was able to go through his phone (I had never done it beforehand) and the messages were there, they did stop with whatever the fuck they had going on but she still had access to him and was texting him “about work” but he hardly responded. \nThis is an issue bc through word of mouth with our mutuals, they said that him and this girl were talking before. He denied, his friend went back on his word…I tried to trust him and keep it moving, he made it clear she doesn’t text him and they don’t talk, but when I got a hold of the messages she was still texting them and everything prior hit me like a train reading it.\n\nI am at loss because I feel like I need to keep the peace and suppress my anxiety and emotions that are so high from what I’ve gone thru with him in order to just keep the peace. I’m definitely stuck because I feel like I can’t leave and I feel like I can work on trusting him again but he doesn’t want to deal with how ugly it gets because I am still incredibly damaged by what he has lied about. His lies have definitely made me spiral and has put me down a lot. \n\nSorry this is all over the place.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758471783.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmwbyw/i_30f_cant_get_over_my_bf_29m_lies/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

For awhile he has been late to dates on average 30 minutes to an hour late, maybe more, and I’ve been late maybe 5 times ever and usually only by 15 minutes to 30 minutes. I’ve told him that this makes me upset, then he goes into his excuses, which its usually his mom making him clean, which I can forgive just I don’t get why he couldn’t of cleaned before it was suppose to be our date. Then with the changing the dates, he will either change the time or change the day. He has changed it to a Sunday when it was supposed to be Saturday and so on and so forth, and I’ve told him that it makes me upset when we have to change our dates every time so he can do something else because sometimes he changes it to hang out with friends. This brings up to now, we had a date planned for Friday because he picked Friday out of the days I was free, but on Tuesday he asked to change it because he was going to go somewhere with friends, and I told him I had school and work on Wednesday and Thursday and he worked the times that I had before I had to go to school and work so I told him that then he asked, “why can’t we do Thursday” so I said again that I worked. Then I got mad saying he makes me feel like I’m on the back burner, and that he always change our dates. He got mad and said he didn’t do a bunch of stuff because of me, but he never told me that he had stuff when I ask him what day we wanna hang out plus he’s the one that picks the day when I told him I’m free, he literally could of picked a different day so he wouldn’t miss as much stuff but I get blamed. He also said “I never said I would or wouldn’t go” but even if he didn’t it sure sounded like he was going to no matter what. After our fight he got distant, he would text simple few word texts and then when I asked why he’s being so distant he said he feels different which I thought meant I was getting dumped but I guess I’m not at least that’s what he said, but he’s still being distant. I told him just to go since our date already got cancelled and “I didn’t want to be the reason he didn’t get to do stuff” since I already was the reason he didn’t get to do a bunch. So he went and I get texted like “mhm” with a random pic of nothing basically, and while I was trying to talk to him and ask how the trip was going, I got a pic of his friend and a random video, so I just said “looks fun” because what am I supposed to say to that, “oh wow, that looks like the funniest trip I’ve seen from the pic of your friend and a random video” and after I texted looks fun, still all I got was a video of his friend, then when I got upset and said “pretty view I guess” and said “I would rather actually text but pics and vids are good I guess” and he said something which I don’t even get. Then I decided to just apologize like I always do because I hate how distant he has been, and I told him I want him to be less distant, which he said “I’m trying to talk tho” I told him a pic and video of his friend and a random video isn’t talking, and that I actually wanted to talk not just videos with him saying literally nothing. Then after that I got a 4 word text that wasn’t about what was going on and I haven’t gotten a text since I texted after that at midnight. He was on snap and hour or two after I texted and has been on insta multiple times from 2am until 8am, and still no texts.

{"id": "1nmvd3p", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "I (31F) &amp; non boyfriend, boyfriend (30M) are moving in together after knowing each other for almost 4 months. What’s the worst that could happen?", "selftext": "Hey Everyone,\n\nSo a bit of background. We met on a dating app in the beginning of the summer and hit it off instantly. We FaceTimed before meeting up in person. We had a date planned, but the night before our date the plans I had got canceled and so I reached out to him to see if maybe he wanted to hang out a night earlier (smoke some weed and hang out). \n\nFor context I was previously in a LTR with a female and so technically a virgin. Because I heard stories about meetups not always going so well I bought condoms (just in case). I thought if for some reason I want to engage in sex or if I’m forced to (I know, sad but true) then at least I’d be protected. Anyway, hanging out was easy and natural and we vibed instantly. We definitely had sex. I felt lucky to have a quintessential first time experience. Everything was so funny and awkward a little at first. The condoms didn’t fit, so we had more delivered and those didn’t either! Eventually we agreed to try without them and that worked. \n\nIt was ok, but more than anything the chemistry we had as individuals really outweighed the maybe not so great first time sex. He spent the night and the next day we hung out until the afternoon. Just like friends. We talked about what we were looking for and we both said nothing too serious. I said I barely felt single and this was my first time on the apps and he said he wasn’t looking for a serious relationship. \n\nAnyway, since we have seen each other and maintained communication. Albeit not so consistently, but I went on vacation and I was dating! I went on a lot of dates and had what I’d like to call a “hot girl summer”. It was fun! However, I kept coming back to him. \n\nThe sex improved so significantly that it’s really just amazing. We’ve gotten to know each other more and we just laugh together the whole time. It has felt so comfortable and natural for both of us. He took me out me meet his closest friends (he calls them brother) and I’ve spent the night at his place many times. At one point we had a break in communication and I was sad about it. When I reached out we spoke and he mentioned that he didn’t like that most of our conversations led to sex. I felt confused because to me “not looking for anything serious” translates to “casual/hooking up”. So I said that to him and said he understood how it could seem contradictory but he wanted to take me out. Since, he has taken me out and we have fun every time. He’s met some of my friends and my dog. He took me out for my birthday and brought up that although he doesn’t want a serious relationship right now, if he did, “you’d be the right match for me”. I asked him to elaborate and to my surprise all of his reasons were about who I was, how he feels with me, and honestly they mirrored how I’ve been feeling about him. Let the record show that I NEVER bring up being in a relationship. I understood casual. He brings up, “I don’t have anything to provide you” to which I say “I didn’t ask you to provide anything for me”. Provide to him is like a car and a house. He totaled his car not that long ago so he’s saving up for a new one. \n\nI realized after some time that I should ask if he was hooking up with anyone else (without protection) because that would change how we interact. His response, “no, I don’t believe in multiple partners and I don’t expect you to be having sex with anyone else either. You have more respect for yourself that to be with someone who’s doing that and I am not like that and I know you aren’t either.” Here’s the thing. That assumes exclusivity which quite frankly I never assumed. Anyway, fast forward and we been what I would call dating for almost four moths. Not in a relationship with titles but definitely happy and in each other’s lives. \n\nWe both have to move soon and the topic came up about how convenient it’d be to move in together. We live in a very expensive city so although we both have great careers, double incomes always allows for more opportunities (nicer apts, cheaper rent, someone to share the bills with). I didn’t think we were being that serious, but then he followed up with more interest. The wild part is that I don’t feel like it would be a bad thing. We’d both have our own rooms and we already stay over about once a week at least. We’re both super clean people and are pretty similar in many other ways. We had dinner and I came with a list of dealbreakers. First one being that we cannot have sexual partners over or even anyone we might be dating. No dating talk at all. Many other things were on there but that was most important out of respect to myself and our shared space. When he read the list I asked what he thought and he said that my number one was also his number one. That he doesn’t plan on dating but when and if I do that will hurt his heart. So we’d have to communicate and stop what we’ve been doing. I agreed that my feelings were the same. \n\nI also told him that I felt like a 1 year lease was much more of a commitment than being in a relationship because a lease is contractual and in a relationship you can end it and walk away the next day. He said he understood and that he wasn’t scared. That all of the people close to him think it’s a great idea. Interestingly enough my friends think it’s a horrible idea. However, my mom and my sister think it’s a great one. My friends think it will be bad for my emotional wellbeing and my mom and my sister feel like his words are saying “no, I’m not ready” but his actions are saying “I like you and I want to explore things further”. \n\nI am not into forcing things and I also am not in a rush. I explained to him, that it already feels like we’re together and that he changed the game when he decided that he wanted to “take me out” and not have it be simply about sex. I even ended up telling him I was a virgin when we met and he wasn’t bothered by it which surprised me. I guess life isn’t always like what you see in the movies. \n\nAnyway, we agreed to move in and we’re looking at apartments this week. \n\nI was wondering what your thoughts were or if you have any advice on how to proceed. I can admit that I like him, but I’m not naive in knowing that that even if we live together that wouldn’t mean we’d be together. \n\nCan someone throw out some worst case/best case scenarios please? \n\nTLDR: me and the guy I’ve been casually dating/hooking up with for 4 months are moving in together. Separate rooms same apartment. We seem to like each other, but he doesn’t “have a relationship in him” right now. What’s the worst that could happen? What’s the best the could happen?", "created_utc": 1758469523.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmvd3p/i_31f_non_boyfriend_boyfriend_30m_are_moving_in/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

As an immigrant, people have always tried to push me out of this space.\n\nAnd yet, I met this man, a colleague I shared an office with, and little by little, I fell in love with him. It wasn’t love at first sight; it grew over time, as we felt so comfortable together in that office. I believe he felt something too. He often tried to get closer to me in subtle ways: always thinking of me, texting me when we didn’t see each other, being physically close. So many things in his body language suggested he had feelings.\n\nBut he’s in a relationship.\n\nWhen I realized the situation was becoming a bit unhealthy, I opened up and told him about my feelings. He said he was flattered but that it wasn’t possible. He looked happy, but also embarrassed.\nA little while later, he suddenly left the office and moved to a different one so that we wouldn’t have to run into each other anymore. That was a real shock.\n\nI respected his decision, took my distance, and completely cut off all contact (we’re not in the same department anyway, except on rare occasions). It’s been two years since all this happened.\nIn that time, I found God through this ordeal, and faith has become the most beautiful discovery of my life, the most incredible experience of love.\nAnd I must admit, it hasn’t separated our hearts. If anything, I feel even more deeply connected to him. I still pray for him, convinced that we’re tied together in some way.\n\nBut he comes and goes.\nHe shows up unexpectedly in my office (which I now share with a toxic colleague who has done nothing but hurt me).\nHe includes me in emails that have nothing to do with me, drops by late in the evening to hang around my office even though it’s completely inappropriate. It’s like he’s trying to make small moves to reconnect while also keeping a lot of distance and running away afterward.\nHe’s very hard to follow and to read.\nWhen I’m around, he tries to impress me, becomes loud and clumsy, while he’s usually very composed and controlled.

{"id": "1nmv5xk", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "Caught my (F24) Bf (M25) in multiple lies.", "selftext": "For a little background, about five months ago, I got a DM from a coworker at his job. This girl I had met before because she was dating his best friend at the time. She told me that she believed my boyfriend and her boyfriend were having sex with two female coworkers at their job. I contacted both of the female coworkers and they told me this was a huge lie on her part. My boyfriend and his best friend explained to me that his best friend cheated on her so she was mad and trying to pull everyone down around her. I was still feeling extremely uncomfortable so I asked if I could see my partner‘s phone for the first time. I have never asked to look through his phone ever but the coworker she accused him of having sex with was always calling him after hours, even though she had a husband and son. I always felt weird about this coworker so I just wanted to look at their messages, but he refused to let me see his phone. I took a few days away from him to gather my thoughts and in these days, I thought he was home but months later I found out he was really in San Diego jet skiing with his friends. I feel like this is a lie by omission because he never even considered to let me know he was in San Diego during a weekend where I was falling apart, thinking he cheated on me. I ended up forgiving him about this and just moving on. I started to feel a little insecure, so I looked through his following list on Instagram and noticed that he followed a new girl about a month after this situation. I asked him who she was, and he told me he had known her since kindergarten. He then unfollowed her without me asking him too… about a week later I realize he had followed her again and this made me feel extremely weird. Mind you, I know I shouldn’t have Looked through his following list, but I was feeling insecure after the whole work allegations. I ended up texting this new girl on Instagram and she let me know that she has never known my boyfriend since kindergarten and that she’s new at his job. I ended up blowing up on my boyfriend, asking him why he would lie about following a female coworker, and why he would even follow a female coworker after his past allegations. Yes those past allegations may have been lies by a hurt girl who was cheated on, but it’s the fact that he lied to me about following this new coworker…. I ended up forgiving him once again.\n\nA few months later, he took a trip to Florida to visit his family. He told me he wasn’t gonna go clubbing in Miami… well the next day he told me he ran into someone and so I went to that person‘s page on Instagram and on their story they were at a club in Miami and I can see my boyfriend in the background. So he was never going to tell me he was a club in Miami… So he lied and said he wasn’t going to club in Miami, but ended up doing it anyway. If he had just told me he was going to a club in Miami it would’ve stung a little bit, but I would’ve moved on and been fine with it. He told me he forgot to tell me because he forgot to bring his phone, but in the screenshot, I can see him on his phone. He gaslighted me for days saying that wasn’t his phone and he was using his cousin’s phone, but I could literally see his phone case. I wasn’t so mad about him going to a club in Miami, but I was just mad at the fact that he gaslighted me when I literally had evidence of him being on his phone in the club. He explained to me that he lies to me because he’s scared of my reactions and doesn’t wanna lose me. I have reacted pretty strongly in the past and I do know that, but I still feel like he should’ve been honest with me about everything. He really is a good man and he’s a great provider. He is also my best friend but I think he has a lying problem and I also have a reacting problem and I just don’t know how to trust him anymore. He is currently in Florida right now and I sat him down to have a conversation with him before he left. I told him that this trip is going to be a time to rebuild the trust so I would like him to update me and be fully transparent with me on this trip. He decided to share his location with me just so I’d feel more comfortable. Well, last night I went to bed early and I woke up in the middle of the night to see his location at a full nude strip club. He claims that he was extremely drunk and his cousins and his best friends went inside the strip club, but left him in the car because he was blacked out. He has done this before when he’s gotten drunk and fell asleep in cars, but since he’s broken my trust in the past, I just don’t believe him anymore. He claims that since I have his location, why would he ever go to a full nude strip club? If I’m just gonna see where he is. In My mind I’m thinking he took advantage of the fact that I told him I was going to sleep early. I love him deeply and I wanna work through this, but how can you work through rebuilding trust if you’ve been lied to multiple times?", "created_utc": 1758469059.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmv5xk/caught_my_f24_bf_m25_in_multiple_lies/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false}

How do we move forward?", "selftext": "So to start from the beginning, my husband and I dated for a year before we were married. I had met all of his close friends, except for one woman (I’ll call her Peeve for some anonymity). He hadn’t spoken to her in 3 years, but mentioned her often. I asked why I hadn’t met her, and he said he was worried she would bully me (loudly and publicly), and didn’t want her around me for that reason. The reason he stopped seeing her was because she would meet her male friends’ new partners, and verbally rip them to shreds in public spaces, and he said he didn’t align with that kind of behavior. So flash forward in our relationship, and he proposed, which meant that I had to fly back to my home country to apply for a visa. The first week I was gone, Peeve was alone with my then fiancé in our flat late, like well past midnight. They were playing video games and making dinner together the exact same way he and I do, which all made me really uneasy. I told him that it crossed a boundary and I felt that I was being replaced in some ways, and asked him to see her during daylight hours and not bring her into my home without me there until I could meet her myself. He argued with me that she’s an old friend, and if he trusts her I by proxy should trust her too. I said I couldn’t until I met her and could decide for myself, seeing as all I’ve been told of her character were pretty awful things. This argument, on top of wedding planning, had resulted in me developing shaking when stressed. He had invited her to our wedding, and I asked him to uninvite her. I don’t know this woman, and she’s crossed a boundary. This also resulted in a multiple day long argument. He eventually conceded, uninvited her, and she proceeded to message every person he knows telling them I’m a bad person and don’t trust him around women. Telling people I was lying about the shaking, taking lots of low blows. He didnt tell me about this for a month, and I asked that we both block her as I didn’t feel comfortable with her having access to me at this point, which he agreed to. She viewed every instagram story of mine while she was talking badly about me, and told my now husband that she was going to make everybody he knows dislike me for uninviting her to the wedding. We hadn’t heard from her since. Flash forward to a week after the wedding, and she’s at an event he’s playing music at. She walks up and gives him a full frontal hug with back scratches right in front of me, and then comes over to hug me. I side hugged her, and left to get a drink. He left me alone in a drink line to chat with her, and listened to her cry and apologize to him for being hurtful, but not to me. She wanted him to stay her friend. She proceeded to lean over the DJ booth all night trying to make song requests. This bothered me, as I asked if we were to see her there, could we be cordial and go our separate ways. That didn’t feel cordial, it felt like he was coddling another woman’s security and comfort over mine- more than once, at this point. \n\nIt’s been a few months, and I’m still angry at him for it. It feels like every day I’m at a low level of upset whenever I look at him, and I’m not sure how I’m supposed to move past it.

I joined college this year  and met a guy in my class (18M) who I initially felt some form of attraction towards, mostly physically. We started talking and found out in under a week that both of us like each other. From then we started this  phase where we aren't dating but we know we like each other and talk daily and hang out together. Keep in mind it's been 1 month till now. Not more than a month.\nThing is, he's a very emotional guy, his love language is physical contact, he also told me straight up he has some trauma because of his last  ex (he has 3 exes) cheating on him. He's also quite hot headed although he's never gotten angry around me or even with me (he says I have a calming presence on him). Me, on the other hand, I'm emotional too but not as much as him, my love language is FAR from physical contact, it's mostly spending quality time, I have 0 exes and no experience so honestly this is a bit scary for me.\n\nI just feel, he's going way too fast. I can see that his emotions and moods depend way too much on me, more than it should. As in if we don't talk properly for a few days and don't hang out as much, he gets depressed and gloomy. When we had exams, I limit my screen time and interactions with everyone overall, but I heard from our mutual friend that me not talking to him as much affected him alot and he kept mentioning that I don't talk to him as much over and over again. Also, the physical contact went way too overboard. I don't like physical contact in any form in public. I've told him that multiple times. It was one of the first things I communicated to him. He did agree and didn't do anything at first, but then it started again- constant hand touches, attempts at hand holding when people weren't watching, hand pulling etc. When i actually consented to physical contact I genuinely liked it, but the random times he tried to do it in public made me uncomfortable which he noticed too and made me distance myself from him.\n\nWe talked alot of things out recently about me being uncomfy, going too fast, his emotions depending way too much on my actions for only 1 month of us liking each other much less KNOWING each other. And he knows it but his replies were that he knows he's an emotional guy, he's possesive, he gets jealous and feels bad when i talk to others and not as much with him. When i mentioned all the times he tried physical contact with me in public to my surprise he has forgotten most instances too. He didn't deny them and apologized for it and said he'll fully back off from any physical touch which I was grateful for.\nHe also trauma dumped on me about his suicidal thoughts, depression and such to which I really didn't know how to reply back. \n\nProblem is, my attraction to him has ...considerably lessened. I can see I should have communicated better, but I didn't even want to talk to him about it. I don't like him as much anymore, I feel uncomfortable even thinking of physical contact with him and his clingyness is making me distance myself from him. I told him I distanced myself, to which he said everytime someone has distanced themselves, they have never come back to him.\nWhich is now painful for me to think about because I was thinking of ending things with him, whatever this stage is.

It’s not like I wasn’t used to it she would need days like that when I lived in my old city as well but I guess I wanted more, we hadn’t seen each other for so long and she was leaving the next day early in the morning and then we wouldn’t see each other for at least a month so that day was our last chance to be intimate. I realise that I have to respect her boundaries but I also have needs, I love her so much and I love everything about our relationship except that we have such different libidos and expectations concerning intimacy.\n\nSo anyways later that night after being mad at each other the whole day I suggested we should break up because we just weren’t compatible, but now I’ve been thinking about it for hours and I keep regretting it and then realising that I’m allowed to feel things too and my needs matter as much as hers.

{"id": "1nmu5oh", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "I (34M) am tired of how my (47F) girlfriend treats me, how do I end things finally?", "selftext": "So a bit of backstory, my girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship where she's a couple hours away from me and can only really come visit me once a month for a couple days at a time. We met playing a game and we originally hit it off and things were going really well, we've been together for almost 2 years now and spend literally every day together when we're not at work.\n\nOver time I've started seeing just how controlling and manipulative she can be. It started when I had an event for work that caused me to be in another city about an hour and a half drive for me for a couple of days. My work paid for a hotel for me and travel expenses, but when I told her about that upcoming event I immediately noticed her mood changed. She started acting very guarded and concerned but wouldn't say what was eating at her and would only respond with \"I hope you have fun\". After some coaxing I finally got it out of her that she was concerned that I might go up there and meet someone else, she's been married twice before and apparently both of her previous husbands had claimed they were going on a business trip and ended up hooking up with people during that time. So I made the compromise that instead of staying in the hotel my work was paying for, I'd drive back home every night and then back up there in the morning since it wasn't a terribly long drive. She was still guarded but that seemed to do the trick to calm her concerns.\n\nOver time I've just noticed things that were standing out to me as odd though. I don't use any social media but I do have accounts from when I was younger such as FB and IG and one day she got super aggressive with me out of nowhere and extremely standoffish. After finally getting her to say more than one word to me, she told me she's always had self-esteem issues and that day she decided to look through literally every inch of my social media accounts to see what I was following and who I was friends with and she instantly felt like she wasn't \"meeting my standards\" because a few of the pages I followed were of the risqué nature. I told her to make a list of the accounts that bothered her and I would unfollow them but assured her that I don't even use those accounts anymore and don't even think about looking at IG so I don't even remember what I was following on there, she did and I deleted them and we moved on.\n\nThere have been instances where I've wanted to go out with some coworkers for dinner or drinks or something, they've been few and far between but I'm newer to the city that I now live and work in so I don't know anyone here outside of work so I figured it'd be a good opportunity to make some friends and get out and socialize. It's only been like 2-3 times that I went out with the guys from work but every single time she basically interrogates me about it. Asking where I'm going, what I'm going to be doing, who I'm going with, are there going to be any females with us, when I'm going to be home, etc. I answer every one of her questions but things still obviously don't sit right with her, it's like she doesn't WANT me to have friends or anyone in my life other than her and my family, and even though she says that she's fine with it, it's plainly obvious that that's not the case. So I go out with my coworkers, I have a few drinks and have dinner and whatnot and I text her throughout the night to give her updates on what I'm doing and when I'm going to be home so that she can be kept in the loop. She'll even go as far as to ask me to take a picture of me and my coworkers together as proof. When I get home, she continues with the interrogation, asking me for very specific details on everything that I did, like she's trying to catch me in a lie or something.\n\nShe's become extremely controlling over so many aspects of m life and I've let her do it, she basically controls what I do when I get off work or on the weekends (because pretty much from the moment I get home from work until time for bed we're in discord together playing games or watching a movie or something), and over night she insists that we stay in discord while we're sleeping so that \"she can hear me sleeping if she wakes up\".\n\nThe latest incident that was finally the straw that broke the camels back was this last Friday I got invited to go out with some coworkers for some drinks, we were celebrating a couple peoples recent promotions at work. So I told her I was going to be going out with some coworkers for some drinks and I would let her know when I'd be going home. Went through the same routine, her grilling me on every minute detail of the plan, etc. Now I go out with these guys and we go to the bar as planned, but we decide to go to another bar instead of calling it a night. So I tell her that I'm going to stay out later than I originally planned and that I would let her know when I'm home and whatnot and she just responds with \"K\" and leaves it at that. \n\nNow unfortunately I ended up having way too much to drink and I end up having to uber home and when I got home it was all I could do to stumble into my place and I passed out before I even hit the bed. I woke up at 7am-ish and I realize I never told her I got home. I immediately text her and apologize and explain what happened and she immediately facetimes me and asks me to show her my room (I'm assuming to make sure I'm telling the truth about being home and to make sure nobody was with me). She proceeds to absolutely break down crying and starts telling me that she didn't sleep at all that night because she started thinking that I was secretly out with another girl and whatnot. She starts saying things like \"You made me like this\", \"You did this to me\", \"I hope you had fun and it was worth making me feel this way\", things like that. I get it that I messed up and I drank too much and didn't let her know, that's absolutely on me, but the way she was saying things made it sound like I did all of this on purpose to hurt her. She then proceeded to say stuff along the lines of \"You can never do this to me again, I don't want you to go out with your coworkers anymore\" to which I really didn't even have a response to.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore, I'm at my wits end, she has so many other controlling characteristics that just don't sit right with me but I let her do them anyway. It seems like she's always complaining about someone or something, whether it be someone at work being an asshole to her, or her mom, or her kids, or the drivers on the road, she's ALWAYS got to complain about someone else. She's always the victim in ever situation she's in, she never owns up to being the cause of anything negative in her life. If I'm having a bad day from work, she's having a worse day. If I have something good happen (such as my recent promotion), then she had a fight with her mom or something. I'll try and talk about something good and she insists on bringing up something negative instead.\n\nI'm a generally pretty positive guy, I like to see the good in situations and I don't like to dwell on something bad that happened, but she insists on ONLY seeing the bad and those kinds of things hold permanent residency in her mind and she refuses to let things go when it doesn't even pertain to her.\n\nTL;DR: Long distance girlfriend is controlling and gaslights me and I'm at my breaking point with things.\n\nHow do I finally get out of this controlling relationship? I feel like she gaslights me into making her past trauma be my fault and she insists on trying to bring my mood down when all I do is try to be kind and caring to her.", "created_utc": 1758466682.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmu5oh/i_34m_am_tired_of_how_my_47f_girlfriend_treats_me/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false}

He doesn’t see me the same way. It’s a strange situation because we are friends with benefits, and he treats me better than any boyfriend I’ve ever been with. Kisses me randomly, brings me small thoughtful gifts, plenty of cuddles, always wants to be around me. Honestly, both of us are a wired a little different and have never found anyone but each other who truly understands us.\n\nWe are long distance now, and he asks to call me every day, for hours (we haven’t started jobs yet after moving but will in a couple weeks) and it’s been over a month of this. He constantly praises me and tells me how much value I add to his life, but still insists he only sees me as a friend. We never tire of each other’s company, find each other very interesting, cool, and hot. The sex is unbelievably good for both of us (we are both very into making each other feel so good and will spend hours and hours to do that) When we were in person together we would have sex daily, initiated by both of us pretty much 50/50.\n\nI’m not sure how much information to put, but he has also never been in a relationship before. He has had crushes that last a few days years ago, but never felt the need to date any of them. He’s also never had hookups or friends with benefits besides me. I initiated the friends with benefits before I had feelings for him.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to stop talking to him because he is my best friend, and we are almost like soulmates. He called us soulmates before I ever did. It’s very confusing. He says that he wants to eventually have a relationship where he loves the girl (which breaks my heart). I’d honestly be okay proceeding just like we are now except that he sees himself maybe eventually finding someone else. He’s not actively looking and won’t actively look, so I have no idea when that would happen because he isn’t the type of guy to initiate anything with a girl.\n\nHe calls us “companions.” He claims what he feels for me isn’t love, but he has never felt love for anyone so I almost wonder if he just has a weird perception of what love is. We have explored that possibility and he remains committed to the idea that he doesn’t love me “like that.” He says I have friend vibes. I don’t understand how you could be how he is with me and only see me as a friend. If I acted how he does with any of my other close friends I feel like I’d be a little weirded out. Like mildly uncomfortable. But he isn’t. He’s perfectly happy basically having a very committed loving relationship with me, but with none of the labels. It hurts. How do I move forward from this?

He was also the one that was usually planning and coordinating dates for us. I’ve grown to really like him and could see myself falling for him, and he knows this.

{"id": "1nmtwig", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "Me (20F) just lost my best friend (19M)", "selftext": "**tldr**: A and I used to be close and he knows about my depression and anxiety. Lately we barely talk unless I reach out. Yesterday we had a long talk and he admitted our friendship has drifted, it has been too heavy emotionally for him, and he doesn’t believe in best friends anymore. He is closer to others and prefers lighter conversations now. I appreciated his honesty but it hurt realizing he no longer sees me as a best friend. I texted saying I respect his boundaries but he hasn’t replied, and I am struggling with losing the closeness I finally let myself have with someone.\n\n**Full Story:**\n\nOn the first month, we were talking quiet a lot. However, these past few months during internship, I haven’t been talking to A (the friend I’m having problems with) much lately, and even then it’s like every 15–30 days when I don't reach out (and usually we only talk because I reached out). A knows that I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety. Yesterday I had a talk with him and it started off pretty casually at first like how’s life etc, but the conversation took a deeper and darker turn.\n\nAlso on a side note, we had already agreed to vc on Saturday night a week ago and he forgot about it. When I asked him if we are still vcing, he asked \"like what u want to do\" which to me was like a soft rejection in a way because what else do you do in a vc? Isn;t it to talk? Which we agreed on?\n\nI brought up how I feel like we haven’t been talking much and we seem to have drifted, and A agreed. He also opened up that these past 2 years he feels like he has been hiding it too, where our friendship feels too heavy emotionally, especially with how I have been coping poorly with my depression. So I actually wasn’t wrong when I realised that he has been avoiding me to a certain extent, especially being alone since that was when I tend to bring up darker topics and my suicidal feelings and insecurities. However, when I brought this up previously he always said that I was just overthinking it and denied any of it. I also only opened up after he explicitly said that he would always be there for me and he is more than happy to listen to any struggle I have, no matter how bad it is (him knowing about my mental health diagnosis). I've started to notice that he was withdrawing from me gradually since last July even though he gave me a birthday card in June stating that I was his best friend.\n\nHe said that we have definitely drifted ever since year 2 and that after internship, when we are going to be back in class again, we probably won’t hang out as much either. He said he probably won’t even associate with the friend group much anymore since he realised that there’s no point being tied down and that B, C, D, etc. are fine being without friend groups anyway. He also said that the past few months overseas has been like a relief for him especially since we haven’t been talking much, and I could definitely tell. While I appreciate him saying it honestly and openly, it filled me with a lot of dread and yet at the same time relief. Dread that it might be the end of our friendship and we could never go back to how it was before; relief that I wasn’t overthinking things and it was true that what I perceived happened.\n\nA also stated that he doesn’t believe in the need for best friends anymore, and honestly it hurt so bad to know that what I felt in our friendship was true. He no longer thinks of me as a best friend and he also stated he has become close friends with B. He has been talking to others like C, E, and D, and everything has been more light-hearted, which he prefers compared to how our friendship is. He says that he even shared with B about how he feels that every conversation he has (he didn't explicitly say it was with me) seems to take a sad turn. He also stated he hated how I always asked questions like where and who when he tells me things, but I've always thought it was just a normal conversation thing? Like when I asked him oh what movie did u watch with so and so and he refused to reply to me even though he was the one that brought it up or like what did you talk about. And yet when I talked about how I was speaking to some new friends etc he wanted to know the contents of it too.\n\nTowards the end, the talk had shifted to lighter topics where he even said that he would be free in October after our internship and he even told me to watch the chainsaw man anime so we can watch the movie together etc.\n\nThen after the call, I decided to just send over a text, saying \"thanks for being honest, i get where u r coming from and i'll respect that boundary\" but he still hasnt replied despite being online and active :(\n\nAlso for more context, prior to him explicitly stating that he considered as as best friends, I never had that expectation and it was also partly my fault this situation turned out like this as I clocked it from the start in a journal I wrote a long time ago:  might also be someone that will never tell me anything, and it could be either his morals or his perception of me and our friendship.  He will never tell me directly and every detail. It’s something I’m dissatisfied with but I’m not sure how to go about telling.  has been subjected to too many rantings on my part and I don’t know how he feels about it. While he says that he is fine with it, he is also the type to keep things to himself and I don’t have enough trust yet to believe otherwise. And with all my ranting, while I feel like I am experiencing life more lately and less detached and uncaring about everything, I feel like it is something that may damage our friendship. I have decided that it is probably better for me to simply treat everyone in the friend group strictly to school friends, or maybe as people to purely have fun with. But they are not suited to be people I can truly be emotionally vulnerable with in the future.  I need to stop saying my true thoughts because they won’t be equally genuine and their moral values do not align with mine and they don’t seem to take what I say well.  (it's slightly cutoff at parts of the sentence as I'm too lazy to censor the names but this is mainly talking about A)\n\nThis journal was written after an incident where my roomate left me in the hotel room while I was asleep with high fever and triggered my pasts trauma of being trapped in a dark room and I couldn't but rant about it (if u want to know more context I can say it too)\n\nSorry if I'm rambling too much and so on, but I'm feeling too emotional right now as A was a person that I had finally let in after years of purposely maintaining shallow relationships, and him being the one to first put a label of best friend on our friendship and now breaking it off.\n\nI'm open to hearing perspectives and upfront advice which I badly need right now", "created_utc": 1758466068.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmtwig/me_20f_just_lost_my_best_friend_19m/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmtrxj", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "title": "All I (26m) want in my life is to finally be with her (25f)", "selftext": "I apologise for the dramatic caption; however, I believe this is the best title for this story I could think of. First of all, I do know that I am an asshole and a huge one at that. That does not change the fact that I am in love, and as you all know, it is simultaneously the best and worst state of mind to be in.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. Last year, I (26m) started talking to the girlfriend (25f) of one of my friends, whom I will call Jason (26m). We quickly found out that we enjoy each other's company a lot, perhaps a bit too much. We quickly developed feelings for each other, even though we both were in long-term relationships (I was married at the time). There are no words that could describe the love that very shortly came over us as we realized that we are soulmates (I know, cringe). How did it happen? Well, firstly, we had rather similar interests in \"culture\" as in video games, movies, TV shows, music, etc. Then, we started talking more and more, not necessarily about those things but about life in general. That's when she started sharing with me how unhappy she is with my friend. The horrors that she described to me still terrify me to this day. She told me how lonely she feels all the time, how he refuses to listen to her about everything, how the sex is painful, unfulfilling, and simply dreadful. It really was a lot of hardcore stuff. At the time, I was already convinced that I myself was not happy with my marriage; it was just a matter of time before me and my (now ex-)wife (26f) would start discussing divorce. My ex-wife moved abroad shortly after for work to earn some money, which was not really possible to do in the city where we lived.\n\nMe and the love of my life (let's call her LoML in short) started talking about the future and what we both wanted from our relationship. We both came to an agreement that we wanted to be together and I know this may sound stupid, as at that time we'd only known each other for a few months, but mind you, it was not only the fact that we could not live without the other half, but also because we were both very unhappy in our current relationships. I want to emphasize that - we really saw the dangers of our decision, yet we still decided that this is what we wanted to attempt.\n\nMy ex-wife and I divorced shortly after, yet LoML and Jason were still together. And that is because she could find the strength to break up with him, as she was the victim of very abusive relationships in the past, which also included very messy breakups, so she wanted to do this one right. It started to become a problem as the months passed, and her attempts to end her relationship were consistently futile. Even when she found the strength to talk to him about it, he would always brush it off, without taking it seriously. Over the course of this whole story, it happened maybe 4 to 5 times. It was almost the same every time - she would promise to try to break up with him, yet every time it went horribly wrong, never progressing in any significant way.\n\nSo while our relationship was becoming more and more intimate, LoML was still stuck in her relationship with Jason. I did not try to blame her for that, I understood that she was in a very stressful and terrible spot, and it was becoming too much for her. And I believe that this is the right time to tell you that I really believe to this very moment that she loved me and wanted to be with me, I have no doubt about that. The efforts that she put into making my every day brighter, the things she said and did, it was all so much that I cannot believe how lucky I am to have had someone like this in my life, even for just a moment. She is my everything and I am 100% sure, without any doubt that she also wanted for us to be together; she was just too scared to reach for it.\n\nThere were moments that I mentioned, where she tried to end things with Jason, with no avail. During most of them, I explicitly stated that even though I wanted her more than anything in life, I could not keep living like this, and if she was unable to break things off with Jason - that's okay, and I will just try to live my life without her. That proved to be impossible. Even when we were apart for just a few days, we both missed each other so much that we could not eat, sleep, or function at all. So we always found our way back into each other's arms. Our love was too strong for us to live without the other person. Still is.\n\nIt went on for a year and a half. On Monday (15.09), she was supposed to try for the last time. And as you can guess, it went exactly as always. He brushed everything off, saying, \"Well, we can work on that\". That's what he always said, and from what I heard, nothing really changed for more than a few days. So I said, \"Okay, then I will leave for real this time,\" and blocked her on almost every platform I could think of, not to be tempted. However, like every white dude in his mid-twenties, I suffer from anxiety attacks, and this was the moment that really broke me. I started thinking about everything that happened, and in that fucked-up state I've decided that I want to come clean to Jason about everything. I realized that maybe in the end it was all pointless, and all I did was hurt my friend in such a cruel way. LoML tried to reach me, and when I finally decided to pick up, she begged me not to tell him and, to my utter shock, she said that she would break up with him if I did not tell him about us. She was more scared of him finding out than anything else. I said no, as it was no longer about me and her; it was about me trying to do this one thing for myself and Jason, who obviously did not deserve any of that, no matter how shitty of a boyfriend he was. She begged me for literal hours until I agreed. She sent him the message that she wanted to break up soon after.\n\nThen, Jason messaged me and told me about the breakup. I desperately wanted to tell him everything but I took my promise to LoML very seriously, so I just stayed with him for a while, talked, and played a game with him. While we were talking (on Discord) he suddenly said \"wait, LoML is calling\" and muted himself. I immediately realized that she was probably telling him everything, and I was surprisingly fine with that, as I wanted him to know anyway. She confirmed to me that yes, she told him about us, about everything and I asked about his reaction. And then she said that he was not even \"that mad\" and wanted to forgive her. And then, well, I had another panic attack that was so severe that I really thought that I was dying. She expected that to happen and called me to tell me that it does not mean that they will stay together, and asked me if I wanted Jason to come and stay with me. I was shocked but also really fucked-up so I said yes. \n\nJason really came and we talked for about two hours. He seemed very calm, almost like he did not care about the whole situation. I told him everything that I could think of, how I loved her (she also told him that she loves me), and I was really shocked that he seemed fine with all of that. We even lightly joked about the situation and how fucked up it was. Then, the plan was clear. LoML was to go to the psychologist (she was in therapy for a while at the moment, which was supposed to help her find the strength to break up with Jason), talk to her friend who knew about everything, and then make her final \"choice\". I also explicitly stated that if he wanted for me to simply walk away, I would not. I promised her many, many times that whatever happens, I would always fight for her and never give up on us. To this moment and for all eternity, I will keep this promise.\n\nAnd she did. After talking to them, she called me to tell me that nothing had changed and that she wants to be with me, to be finally happy. We also talked with my friend (21f) about the situation, as she also knew about everything almost from the very start. The decision was supposed to be final and we would finally be together, after all that crazy shit. And it pains me to say that it did not happen. When Jason finished work that day, she started talking to him, and as I had work the next day, I could not stay until it was over. The next day, during a break at work, she called me and the first thing she said was \"He is going to tell my parents\".\n\nNow, I have to explain that LoML is absolutely terrified of her parents. They control every aspect of her life, they send her money and pay for everything so she can study and live abroad. Every time she talked about them, she seemed absolutely terrified of them, and the prospect of them finding out that she had had an affair for such a long time was simply dreadful to her. Look, I do not want to call this blackmail (some of my friends strongly believe that that's what it is), but you have to understand - after discussing the matter with her friend and her psychologist, she told me that she was absolutely sure. Some of her friends and mine also heard the same thing from her. She was sure. And the next thing I hear is that \"he is going to tell my parents\". So I cannot help but think that it was some kind of power play, which some may argue is understandable, judging by how desperate he was and how hurt he was. I also cannot help but hate him for that. I understand how fucked up everything that we did was, but now, he is doing something like this to the person he supposedly loves.\n\nSo, at the moment, almost all of our friends know now, I have a lot of support from people who have known about our relationship for a very long time and have heard her say that she wants to be with me before, well, whatever the fuck happened. I am very grateful to them, as my mental state is not at its best at the moment. He came to her and is staying with her for the weekend. We haven't talked (me and LoML) for two days because obviously, he would see everything that we send to each other. I cannot eat, nor sleep. I keep vomiting constantly, and cannot focus on anything at all; writing this all down was like climbing Everest for me. I thank you for reading all of that and apologize for the chaotic storytelling, as my life is equally chaotic at this time. Also, English is not my first language so if anything sounds weird or is hard to understand, I am also happy to correct any mistakes I've made in this post.\n\nI am happy to answer any of your questions, and I have to admit - I do not know the reason for telling you our story. I only ask for one thing - please do not be too harsh on her, I do realize how all of that sounds but you have to remember that she endured a lot in her past and for the last few months. She was and probably still is so scared and l do not blame her for anything that happened, as I know how abused and miserable she has been for her whole life. Please, remember that.\n\nI can only repeat myself in saying that I will not give up. I will die before I give up on this woman. And I am sure that she is, as you know already, the love of my life.", "created_utc": 1758465758.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmtrxj/all_i_26m_want_in_my_life_is_to_finally_be_with/", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

Obviously, there is no right or wrong answer. But maybe I will find some insight.\n\nLong story short, we were online friends for a long time, then he visited and we developed mutual romantic feelings. He didn't want a relationship, but wanted to stay friends. I knew it is not possible to shift from one feeling to another so fast, but we stayed in contact for over a month, while trying to figure things out. During this time, our communication got distant eventually and at some point I realised that I can't go on like that, because it is just not what I want. He also started preferring no contact at some point, to get over his romantic feelings. I have hurt feelings and he seems to be irritated if something personal comes up. So no contact really is the only thing to do here.\n\nWe had always talked that if we decide to stop talking, we would discuss it and he always highlighted that he wants to reconnect some time later. But our chats got a bit sensitive during the last days and we both expressed the wish to finally make that decision to go no contact. And the questions is when (or if ever) to reconnect.\n\nI'm just not sure if having an agreement, that he will reach out after some time, is something that would help or not. If I'm quite honest, I don't really have a lot of faith in building a friendship again after romantic feelings. But in a similar situation, reconnection actually helped me to move past the feelings I got stuck on. Because I understood he isn't interested in friendship or anything else, realised I still had feelings,  but after that I was able to keep processing the loss. And finally get over it. So I have the experience that reconnecting helped in situation, where there was a vague idea of continuing as friends in a distant future. It helped to move on with my life and let go of that feeling that things are still up in the air.\n\nBut to have a certain time frame (like, reconnect within a few months or so), can maybe create some expectations? I do want to get over my feelings for him and go on with my life, just to do it in a way that is helpful for me. I know no one can say what the right answer is for me, just putting the post out there and maybe I get some thoughts to reflect on.\n\nWhen it comes to the idea of becoming friends again, like I said, I doubt it can happen, but also, I don't want to totally dismiss the idea either. It did happen with one person, although after a few years of not talking. And with the person right now, we never had an actual relationship (which makes it more difficult on one hand, but also probably less emotional on the other) and were friends most of the time we've know each other.\n\nAppreciate the insight and your thoughts on the matter!:)", "created_utc": 1758465695.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nmtqz4/i_f38_and_my_friend_m40_developed_romantic/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false}

We got close quickly and involved our families within 1–2 months. She told me she hadn’t been emotionally/physically involved with anyone for 6 years. She had 2 boyfriends in the past, which I was fine with.\n\nHowever, with time I got to know she was actually in a relationship for the last 1.5 years (which ended only after she felt I was “the one” for her). This means there was about a 1–2 month overlap. (I think this guy got cheated in beginning of their relationship also, there was one casual thing she was involved 1.5 years ago, this was also hidden from me), I checked her phone :(\n\nThe issue is not just the past relationship but the way she disclosed it. She initially said it was just “an arranged marriage guy she never talked to.” Later, it became “we only talked for 6 months but never met.” Then it turned into “we met parents but nothing more.” Eventually, I found out she went on multiple trips with him and was physically involved (she insists it wasn’t sexual, but still physical).\n\nThis was very hard for me because:\n\n•\tShe was the one who insisted she hadn’t been emotionally/physically involved for 6 years. She often judges others for being physically active before marriage, so I trusted her words at face value.\n\n•\tI was completely transparent about my past, including relationships and physical aspects, even doing an STD test because she was concerned.\n\n•\tI tried to give her comfort by sharing how my own brother was ditched in arranged marriage due to lack of “feeling,” and I respected that girl’s honesty. But in my case, my fiancée kept me in the dark.\n\nBecause of this, I find myself doubting every detail she shares. I even catch myself visualizing her past a lot, which fuels my compulsive thinking. I went to therapy, and the therapist said I do struggle with compulsive thoughts, but also that I would need a very honest partner to cope. He suggested I at least explore whether her pattern of judging others but hiding her own actions might point to deeper issues (possibly borderline traits, though I’m not sure if it’s just human inconsistency).\n\nThe girl insists we should move on and promises everything will be okay. But my trust feels broken. For me, an immediate breakup before meeting a new partner always felt like a red flag - I believe at least 6 months of gap is needed to heal (am u wrong for having personal choice and getting mad because i was denied of information)\n\nI won’t deny I may have some male ego involved here, but this feels more than that. All my ex-partners had past relationships too, but this hidden 1.5-year relationship has made me obsessed and angry in ways I haven’t felt before.\n\nOn the other hand, the first two months with her felt magical. We even discussed having a baby soon, and emotionally it felt different from anything I’ve experienced. That’s why I’m torn. She also lied about her age also (1 year, I got to know after all these came up)\n\nShe is not ready to end things, but I don’t know if I should stay or walk away. I would really value women’s perspectives on this.\n\nHer part of story is story is she was not happy in that relationship and was feeling the pressure of family and society so it got dragged, but didnt I deserve to know this in the beginning?\n\nWrite tldr very small for Reddit post\n\nTL;DR: Girl (31) hid a 1.5-year relationship that overlapped with us, initially claimed no involvement for 6 years.

Based on stuff she said in previous conversations, I asked if she would still feel anxious if she was clothed/not being touched but still giving oral, and she said she had been wanting to bring up that possibility since she really enjoys giving but gets anxious if she's involved otherwise. She has also said previously and since that sex isn't something she thinks about and that she's probably on the ace spectrum.

I suppose I'll give as much context as possible, but not in this first paragraph, as I don't want it to be in the preview of the post haha. I will start by saying that, while I am incredibly insecure about this situation and potential future situations, I do *not* want to limit her or even make her feel that something is off. I don't want to control her, even unintentionally, with the way that I may wear my mood on my sleeve.  She seems to be catching on and I want to nip this in the bud, either by breaking up or by changing myself.\n\n\n\nHer and I have been together for a year now and we're in a strictly online relationship. We met online and have not yet met in person, though we plan to in two months. Throughout the first few months, we spent all of our waking hours together. I understand this is not sustainable- I'm just giving context. Before this, I wasn't doing well and it seems like she wasn't either. We seemed to... help each other, though I can't really speak for her. We would help each other be productive, encourage each other- I feel like I only got through this summer because of her. I know. I am sounding very attached. Which is true. But I *could* live without her. I just don't want to. And she expresses the very same sentiments. We have been and were, very early into the relationship, talking about marriage and kids and being together permanently. We moved into and through this relationship so rapidly that time doesn't make any sense anymore and I feel like I've been with her for years. Nearly every day for the past year, we've spent 12-24 hours together. We get along so well. Everything seems so perfect. I find her so endlessly fascinating and I can hear her speak for hours. We have fun together doing all sorts of activities. Crafts, video games, movies, listening to music- we kind of always try and find something new and branch out. I want to be with her forever. We only recently have started to run out of things to talk about and I sometimes get insecure that it's because I'm inherently a boring and uninteresting person, though both of us have also just recently gotten significantly busier. Still, we are very serious and are looking into moving in with each other next year, if the meeting goes well. Now. Here's the situation.\n\n\n\nShe has this friend she met online in a gaming group. They would all play games together. She would always invite me, but I would get unimaginably nervous and simply couldn't, so I always opted out. Lately, she's been playing more often with this one guy individually. They still just play games, but now it's games that we play together (before, it was an online group party game and I am not good in groups, hence me being nervous.) I don't know, this made me sad, but I knew it wasn't reasonable. However, she... hung out with that friend again and something was a little different this time and my insecurity is getting the best of me. She told me she was going to \"hang out with someone.\" I asked her who and she told me with a friend. I asked where they were going because I thought it was an in-person friend and she said it was just that same online friend with whom she invited me to play. Now she lives in a country literally on the other side of the world from both myself and said friend. Thus, my jealousy is not stemmed from a romantic angle. What are the odds she would find someone she wants to be with online, again? Plus, if one were to cheat in an online relationship, why not go for someone who can offer something you can't, that being, well, being in-person. I trust her in that sense. However, our relationship to this point has been immensely close. I suppose I got used to how it was? I certainly do NOT feel entitled to have all of her time, nor do I not want her to have friends, but, I don't know-- I feel... jealous. Again, not because I think she'll cheat on me-I don't. This is more of a social jealousy. I'm not at all worrying that she'll fall in love with some random guy. In fact I'd prefer that because I'd be justified. As it is, I am not justified. Rather, I feel immensely saddened that there is clearly something that I'm not providing that someone else can provide. Part of my sadness likely has to do with the fact that they started with playing games with other people. Then they were playing games alone. And recently... they watched a show together. A show..? Is that not more intimate? Again, not intimate in a romantic sense, but... I don't know? It kind of feels like it was our thing. Additionally, they watched multiple episodes for two hours. And before this, I felt, despite my occasional stress that we have nothing to talk about, that we were having a lovely conversation before she told me she had to leave. Now, I get it. It's, again, unreasonable to expect all of her time. But, I don't know. I don't feel entitled to it. If I did, I think I would've brought it up and started a fight about it.\n\n\n\n I can take the fact that they're watching tv together two ways. One: the fact that online friendships are so limited in what they can do implies that this means nothing because they just wanted to branch out a bit. However, two: I can take it that, because online relationships are so limited in what they can do, I can offer just as much as this guy because we can do all of the same things. Thus, if he's able to offer the same things, but happens to be more intriguing, or better at conversing, etc., what if she comes to really value their friendship more than ours? Is this problematic? I know it is. But... I can't help but feel this way. I want to feel differently, but I'm so jealous that my heart beats irregularly and I shake when I think about it. I'm so jealous of the fact that she gets something out of someone else. I don't know.  I just feel sad, worthless, and like I'm not enough for her. I mean, that's technically true in a sense as I know that she needs social interaction besides myself, but I think I take it to heart too much and it's making me fall apart. I don't want to limit her, but I feel like I can't come to terms with this. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Is it better to save her from what may come to be a strain on my mind, even if I don't ever push it upon or hold it against her? She already has seemed to catch on that my mood has been down lately. I find it easy to obsess over things for weeks, without much ability to let it go or think about anything else. What is the best course of action?

He has a stable job and works as a farmer in his free time (can't live off of it). In my dating profile I mentioned that I am looking for a long term partnership and want to have kids. He said that he's looking for a life partner and also wants kids. After we matched he asked me if I could see myself moving to the countryside. I said I didn't know. Then he said without me asking he could see himself giving up the farm for a partner.\nThe second time I met him, I asked him for how long he has been single. He said about 10 years. He said (later) that he felt like the woman he was with was like a child and that he didn't want to take care of someone not mature enough. I really vibed with that answer.\nWell, now 2 months later, I'm absolutely falling in love with him. We get along great. He's funny, intelligent, sex is great. \nI discovered that he never really had a relationship. \nAbout a month ago I told him that I'm falling in love with him. He said he likes me too. I was really hurt and he said he can't express emotions well.\nAbout a week ago he said that he wants us to be exclusive. I agreed.\nTwo days ago I discovered that he broke off the few times where he could have had a relationship because he couldn't handle the commitment. He said the thought of commitment makes him anxious. This also applies to me. He said it's a him issue and not a me issue. I have mentioned before the possibility of therapy, he said that's not for him. After our talk 2 days ago I asked what is different now, relating to now finding (and keeping) a partner. He said he hopes it's different now. At the same time he's planning to go on vacation with me in 2 month and in about half a year. And there's the issue with where to live and the future. We can't live 2h apart forever. We're both working full-time jobs and he has his farm. There's a lot of dependency on weather conditions, where you need to work on the field asap. I don't know how a family would fit into that since I'm not planning on being a full time mom. I want my partner to also be home with the kids when they're very young (and me working).

He fell into congestive heart failure after getting his teeth cleaned, he didn’t wake up right after the anesthesia and they did x rays and he had a giant heart and fluid in his lungs. I saved him at the ER vet for $5k, took him to a veterinarian cardiologist and follow up visits for another $4k, spent $200+/month on heart medications for him for 8 months, bought him prescription food, had to force feed him 3 pills every 12 hours precisely or he’d risk going back into heart failure. They said his heart failure was “end stage” his heart was so large and he had blood clots that could burst any time. The ER vet said it wouldn’t be an unsound decision to have him euthanized then. But I had to try, he was my first and only baby! I didn’t understand the weight of the commitment of the medications to the debt I’d never been in before. From there, after deciding to try to save him, I did everything you were supposed to do.\n\nI paid for all of this with care credit and maxing out my credit cards and two years later I only recently paid it all off. I had no partner, family or support system to help give him pills. I suffered severe anxiety about his medication schedule, that he could burst a clot, get saddle thrombus, and suffer while I was away at work for 9 hrs a day. I couldn’t afford a petsitter qualified to pill him so I didn’t see my out of town family or friends for the whole 8 months, and traveling with him just in the short car ride to the vet skyrocketed his respiration rate for hours it was so stressful for him, I definitely couldn’t travel with him.\n\nOn top of this, he regularly had episodes of aggressively attacking me for no apparent reason for the past 4 years of his life. He would chase me into rooms and hiss and spit and attack the door, when he did catch me he would bite and kick my legs and ankles and arms and not let go. And then he’d go back to being my sweet, cuddly, affectionate boy. It was a miracle he event LET me give him pills.\n\nIt all consumed my life. I loved him so much, I thought I could keep up with the medication schedule and the cost of it all but eventually I felt the only relief to the whole situation was to have him put to sleep. And this decision kills me to this day. I went to therapy for 3 months leading up to the day I said goodbye to him and for 8 months afterwards. My primary vet counseled me on options, like trying only giving him meds once a day and see how he did, rehoming him, etc. The cardiologist stressed the importance of the 12 hours timing and it would cause me even more anxiety to know he was technically missing a dose so I didn’t want to do that.\n\nAnd as far as rehoming him, who would want to adopt a cat with regular, unpredictable aggressive episodes AND end stage heart failure- would they keep taking him to the cardiologist for $800 check ups? Would they be as gentle as me giving him his pills? Would they be as tolerant and forgiving as me when he aggressively attacked them multiple times a week? He attacked my dad once and the way my dad kicked him off of him mortified me in that one instance. (He did this even after recovering from the severe heart failure). I feel like some people would have put him to sleep for that behavior itself.\n\nWhy this kills me so much is that he was doing so well on his meds. He seemed literally completely normal and healthy. His personality was the same, his cattitude was the same, he loved playing with his toys and running through his tunnel and ekekeking at birds outside. I just felt so completely isolated and financially trapped it was causing me so much distress and anxiety. So I did it. I had him put to sleep. We spent his last day cuddling and playing outside and eating his favorite forbidden human food treats and temptations. And honestly, the relief I felt after saying goodbye to him was so profound. I felt like I had a $10,000 weight lifted off my shoulders. I felt like I could finally move forward. I started doing the things I loved and seeing the people I loved again.\n\n2 years later, I finally felt like I was in a good enough place to get two kittens. They’re 7 months old now and they are the light of my life, they helped heal a lot of the lingering trauma from my last cat. I’m in a long term relationship, I’m doing better financially, they have pet insurance.. but I almost just feel like I don’t deserve them because I feel like I gave up on my last cat. Like if I could have just been a little bit stronger for a little bit longer maybe he could have been with me still. I know his heart was really bad but I just always wonder how things would have gone if I just stuck it out. I love my current babies with every fiber of my being, but getting them almost re-ignited my grief over my last cat. I’m so hypochondriac over the kittens it feels a little unhealthy. I watch their breathing obsessively out of habit from having to track my last cats respiration rate and am constantly reminding myself they’re just crazy hyped up kittens. Thinking about the fact that they will eventually need dental work down the road scares the hell out of me.

{"id": "1nmu9lx", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "Saved my whole youth, avoided parties and dating &amp; now the house goes to my sister. How is this fair?", "selftext": "Hi, I want your opinion. I’ve been working really hard, doing three jobs just to build savings. I don’t come from a rich family, my parents always lived paycheck to paycheck. Luckily, my dad bought a house when he was young and managed to pay it off before retiring. But he didn’t have any real investments. When he retired, he got a lump sum of about 150k, but to my surprise, it wasn’t much. After just three years, it was already down to 70k. My mom does have an investment account, but the amount is not that much either.\n\nSo in the future, I don’t expect to inherit anything, except the house. I’m okay with that, because it’s my childhood home, where my siblings and I grew up. The house not that big, not that fancy.\n\nThat’s why I work three jobs, I hustle to save as much as I can. I’m male, 28. I avoid parties, I rarely hang out with close friends, I don’t date, I don’t gamble. I save, save, save. From my income, I only use 20% for my car, bills, and food. The other 80% I put into my investment account.\n\nThe reason is simple: first, because I don’t come from a wealthy family. If my parents die one day, at least I won’t be shocked, I can survive because I’ve always managed myself. Second, I don’t think I’m smart enough to join big companies or get a super high salary. My three jobs are like small businesses. It’s not sustainable forever, but right now, I’m working hard to save for my future.\n\nMy sister is the opposite. She loves gambling, buying new clothes, going to parties, hanging out with friends, and going out with her boyfriend. She even pays for her boyfriend’s tickets sometimes, just because she loves him. When she’s short on money at the end of the month, sometimes my parents help her with fuel or insurance. Her salary is only $500/month, but $100 is automatically deducted into her investment account, and she uses the rest to enjoy her life.\n\nOne night, my family discussed marriage. They asked us children when and who we plan to marry. Me? Obviously I don’t have anyone, and marriage is not my priority. My youngest sibling is only 18, still studying. My sister has a boyfriend of three years, and he earns about $2000/month, four times her salary.\n\nAnd then my mom said something that shocked me. She said the house we grew up in will go to my sister. I was like, *WTF*. Why? She said, “Because she’s a girl.”\n\nI got angry. So her future husband will also enjoy this house for free? He earns enough to rent or buy a place himself. Why does he get a free house just because he married my sister? It doesn’t make sense.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not that I’m obsessed with the house. But it’s a sentimental place, it should be the one house where the whole family can always come back and gather, not a place where my sister and her husband live as if it’s theirs alone.\n\nIt just feels so unfair. I sacrificed my youth, worked so hard, saved money, gave up so much, while my sister enjoyed her life. Sometimes my parents even gave her money. And now she gets a free house too?\n\nGrowing up, my parents always said, *“She’s a girl”* as the reason she got more than me. For me, I only got one new pair of sandals every Christmas, sometimes not even that. But my sister got new sandals for class, for hanging out, for holidays. For shoes, I had to save my pocket money $1 a day until I had $45 to buy a pair. Not even original, just something to wear to school and events. Meanwhile, my sister always had plenty.\n\nNow, I can’t help but hate seeing my parents sometimes. I never show them my struggle, because I’m a man, and men don’t show weakness to their parents. That’s why I moved away and rent a small room for $150/month.\n\nLife feels really unfair. I fought a lot with my dad growing up, he has a temper and I was always the one scolded. Sometimes I talk back, sometimes I just run away and let him be angry alone. When I tell my mom how I feel, she always says, *“He’s your dad, respect him.”* It feels like she never listens to me. That’s why I always hide my feelings.\n\nSometimes I even feel like I can’t handle this life anymore, like I just don’t want to go on.", "created_utc": 1758466926.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nmu9lx/saved_my_whole_youth_avoided_parties_and_dating/", "score": 48, "num_comments": 86, "over_18": false}

Diving deep into drinking and being in an extremely bad head space, ultimately causing some unwanted (but needed) \"side effects\" within my command. And while I still drink, I couldn't tell you the last time I was actually drunk. \n\nAbout a month and a half (maybe 2) ago, I figured enough was enough and figured it was time for a change. I started working out, reconnecting with old friends back home (virtually), going on hikes every morning, started at college where I'm weirdly thriving, and making a point to take Ubers when I have time off to take myself on dates. \n\nIt hit me last night as I spent yet another night just sitting at my desk watching YouTube videos with a beer; I'm lonely... My \"friends\" both here and back home, are only friends when it's convenient for them. They never want to hang out, grab a drink, play games, nothing, unless there's something I can provide for them in turn. \n\nThe only people I religiously talk to on a daily basis are my family, and I'm happy that I'll be able to go home on leave soon to see them. I'd originally planned on going to see my friends while I was there, but I'm tempted to not even tell them I'm coming home...\n\nIt's harder for me to make new friends around here since I'm one of the \"older guys\" and God forbid I even try dating again. \n\nSo yeah, it's just a cloudy/rainy day and I'm just sitting here in my feelings trying to find things I can do to keep my mind busy, but even games that I usually play and videos I usually watch, just don't seem to be doing the trick. \n\nIf you're still here, well that's more than can be said for most people in my life, so thank you.

My jiju is hell of a charming guy - when I wasn't married I used to look up to him as someone I want to communication &amp; charisma like to be. When he talks, it feels like he’s letting you in on a secret. Everyone laughs at his jokes, but there’s always a sharper edge beneath them.\n\nMy elder sister has 4 kids overall.\n\nRecently I have been noticing the sudden closeness with my wife and me. I didn’t think much of it. He’d drop by with some excuse - to watch cricket together, to ask about the building maintenance, or just to “check in.”\n\nBut I’ve started noticing little things.

{"id": "1nmspch", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "I (21F) had a near death experience with anaphylactic shock.", "selftext": "24 hours ago, I experienced a severe allergic reaction that resulted in anaphylactic shock.\n\nI had had dinner quite late last night, at 11pm. I was hanging out at my boyfriend’s apartment with a couple of friends. My boyfriend and I had gotten into an ugly fight, and in the heat of things I broke up with him. It was also during the fight that I found out I’d gotten rejected from a job I’d been hoping to get.\n\nThe combination of both of these factors caused me to spiral. This made my angel of a boyfriend step back and calm things down, and he held me in his arms as I wept.\n\nLater on, after dinner, I decided to take 2 shots of Bacardi Black along with my friends. It was around 2am. Within 10 mins of consuming it, I started reacting negatively. I’ve had allergic reactions before, but I’d never been able to pinpoint what was the factor. I’d usually sprout up in angry red hives and my skin and scalp would feel like they were on fire. Whenever this happened I’d take a cetrizine and wait it out for around 2 hours.\n\nThis time though, things got worse, very quickly. The pain was never like before, and it hurt to walk. It was as though a very hot liquid had entered my blood stream and was burning my body from the inside. My feet were stiffening up, my entire body was breaking out and I was losing consciousness and shaking uncontrollably. I couldn’t walk straight, and my friends had to carry me to the taxi. I was later told that I had peed myself in the lift, and I was farting the way out.\n\nI remember thinking to myself amidst blacking out that this was the end. Maybe it was my brain’s way of comforting me in what it thought was my final moments, but I had accepted my fate. I realised that I might not make it to the hospital on time, and that if I die now, atleast I’ll have come to terms with it. The severity of what was happening wasn’t registering with me emotionally. As a hypochondriac who’s constantly worried about herself and her family and friends’ health, I thought that I’d be more scared during death, that I’d be fighting my way through. But all I thought back then was - “If this has to happen to me now, so be it”.\n\nI reached the hospital within 10 minutes and was rushed to the ER where I threw up. I vaguely overheard the doctor telling my boyfriend that if I would have gone into cardiac arrest had we been any later. My blood pressure had gone dangerously low, but luckily my throat hadn’t started closing up.\n\nI was administered a fair bit of adrenaline along with a bunch of other medication, and was transferred to critical care, where I was kept under observation for 12 hours.\n\nI was discharged yesterday evening. I’ve had a lot of time with my thoughts, and it doesn’t help. Though my initial reaction to my brush with death was acceptance, I’m finding it really difficult to handle all of the events that occurred within the last 2 days.\n\nI can’t forgive myself for breaking up with my boyfriend. I can’t see myself worthy of his love and forgiveness for me. I can’t deal with all of the micro consequences that have been a result of this - like my mother finding out that I drank through the report, my friends seeing me so vulnerable, my boyfriend being there for me despite our fight.\n\nI’ve gone back home with my mother for a week, to monitor my diet. According to the allergy specialist, the severity of the reaction increases each time it happens, which means the next time could be fatal. Funnily enough, none of the doctors seem to think that the fact that I drank alcohol is relevant, even though I’ve had a much milder reaction when having a sip of the same drink a month ago. I’ll be taking an allergen test in 2 weeks, once I’ve finished my medication.\n\nI’m not doing so well mentally. I’m scared to eat food, because I genuinely can’t narrow down what could have caused this. I’ve eaten the same food from the same restaurant, and I’d been fine. The other times I’d gotten reactions was when I was eating stuff like pizza, shawarma and a sandwich, and it hasn’t happened when I’ve eaten the same items from the same restaurants afterwards. It happens very sporadically and doesn’t seem consistent.\n\nRight now, I feel very isolated. I’m with my family and all they do, especially my mom, is lecture me about my lifestyle, or ask me about details. None of this is helping. I want this whole ordeal to be done with, so I can go back to my life.\n\nI hope that whatever I’m allergic to is something I can easily avoid. I love food, and the fact that I might have to stop eating out makes me very sad.", "created_utc": 1758463160.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nmspch/i_21f_had_a_near_death_experience_with/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false}

Constant anxiety from walking on eggshells. Over analyzing every interaction because you know your always told you are wrong. Someone you enjoyed holding you and felt safe with at one point, is now someone who doesn't even listen when you say no to sex. Ive watched myself shrink so small from the constantly yelled stream of verbal and emotional abuse. I didnt even recognize myself.\n\n\nBut I refuse to say in this prison. I gave up at one point.

I am definitely aware women specifically go through a lot of horrible stuff specifically and their existance is not to be romanticized.\n\nThat said, I can't help but feel jealousy of womens gender role and attractiveness and how femininity in general seems to be favoured over masculinity. Women get pursued, rizzed up, courted, and taken care of. I've met many women who were like \"I'm such a mess and I can't hold a job, but thankfully my wonderful boyfriend takes such good care of me!\" That is something that I feel I'll never have as a man. A man who desires to be taken care of is called a manchild, immature, a user, a red flag and so on. He is expected to be the provider, or at the very least pull his weight. There are cases were women take care of men - after those men have 'proven their worth' by working like mules for years. And even then a man is supposed to be always working.\n\nAs someone who has struggled to hold down jobs due to chronic mental health issues at times in my life this is extremely depressing. It makes me feel like I don't deserve to be loved. I feel like I'm just a wallet, an atm, a tool. Like, no woman has ever asked me about my hopes and dreams or the art that I make. What matters is that I can work like a mule, and pursue and entertain her. I will never be in the positition where a woman will just take an interest in me and try to sweep me of my feet.\n\nNobody except gay men seems to really like the male body. There are a few straight women who like masculine men, but by that their interest seems to be on the likes of Henry Cavill or Jason Momoa, literal top tier males. Like that tweet where woman commented \"see this is what we want, we are not asking for much\" and the picture was a guy with a dehydrated bodybuilder physique playing Superman.\n\nAll this is especially brutal for me because I was bullied a lot growing up for coming across as gay when I was young. That is because I was meek, timid, emotional. The result was to build a tough exterior around myself. I feel like I can't be vulnerable around my friends the way women can.

{"id": "1nmp4yq", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "Another kid tried to drown me when I was 10 and nothing was done", "selftext": "So when I was a kid, my family had a cabana at a local beach. There were lots of other families with kids, too, of all ages. I absolutely loved being at the beach... my family was mega dysfunctional, and at the beach I had a measure of freedom from the drama of home. I spent TONS of time in the ocean, swimming, bodysurfing, just being me, enjoying life without anyone telling me how wrong or stupid or lazy I was.\n\nSo, at the end of our row, there was another kid (boy) who was a bit older than the crew I hung out with- say 12 or 13 to my 10. He would sometimes play with us, but he wasn't a regular member of the group. Now that year i had gotten a yellow two piece suit that I LOVED- it was the color of sunshine and had these circular plastic loops holding the pieces together that left really cool tan lines- plus, it was comforatble as heck and moved with me as I swam or climbed around exploring the tide pools. Also, I was labeled as 'gifted,' so I was less mature socially and emotionally (thanks for the helping hand, parents :/) than others to start with.\n\nSo one day this kid invited me to go fishing with him, and I said no. Was a bit scared to do so, as I'd learned from family (which Ive since come to realize was abusive) that saying no was not allowed. But I listened to my gut, even though I was worried he would be mad at me (again, learning from m y family that angering people = you're in for some bad times.\n\nA few days later, I was swimming by myself while most people were up at the cabanas having lunch. I saw him coming straight towards me in the water, and thought it weird... but if he's coming up to me then maybe he isnt mad and just wants to play. He enters the water and c continues coming straight toward me. He isnt saying a word and I start to worry. He came right to me, grabbed me hard and shoved me under the water... now I had felt angry hands on me before, so I started fighting, trying to get up for air. I fought as hard as my 10 year old body could, and I was a strong kid, but he was much much stronger... I realized that this kid was not playing at all... he meant to harm or kill me. I could hold my breath a long time, bbut no matter how I struggled I could not get to the air... I started thinking i was going to die right then. It all happened so fast that only the fact that I knew that feeling of hands that hate you hurting you saved me. I had to breathe in and water got in my lungs and that freaked me out and I had a burst of strength and somehow broke his grip. Coughing and choking, I heard him speak his first words to me that day- \"that will teach you to stand around in that bikini looking like that.\"\n\nSo this was my first introduction to a guy finding me attractive- saying no meant violence. I truly believe he meant to kill me, and only the fact that I was so strong and also understood the danger I was in saved me, if I had fought less hard I would have been killed.\n\nI went and told my mom, who said not to worry he was just playing around. Nothing further was said, to me or to his family. A few days later, he came to our cabana and gave me a gift of jewelry. I told my mom I did not want it, and she told me to go give it back to him. Now this is a woman who was abusive herself AND married to an abuser, and surely knew that would only put me in more danger. So again, I listened to my gut and said ok to her, but quietly took it home and hid it in a drawer.\n\nSo I learned that somebody can literally try to murder you, and nobody will believe you or cares or protect you, even your own mom. And you are expected to just continue on as if nothing had happened.\n\nTo this day, although I was a super swimmer before this incident, I CANNOT go underwater without holding my nose.

{"id": "1nmot5w", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "Went too far with a relationship I should have ended much earlier", "selftext": "In the beginning of this year, more than two years after my divorce, I (44M) wanted to start dating again. I decided to turn to OLD since that had worked for me in the early 2000's. Well, things were not going according to my expectations and in about 5 months I had managed to have a conversation with a single woman who eventually, after 3 weeks of exchanging messages, decided she didn't want to meet me. So, when another woman (44) approached me on an OLD site I was going to give her a chance, although her profile was mostly empty and had only one very unflattering photo.\n\nWe chatted a bit and exchanged some basic info on what we were looking for in a relationship and what's the status of our lives regarding that. The next day I got a message that she didn't feel that we were compatible. I wished her well and thought that was it, I was not even particularly disapointed. A couple of days later she messages me again and says that I, saying I was introverted, had scared her and she was overreacting and wanted to meet. We agreed on a lunch date on the next weekend.\n\nWhen she arrived on the date she looked much better than in the photo I had seen. She was actually reasonably attractive, although she was considerably bigger than me. We discussed over lunch and she seemed quiet and even somewhat timid. I had to keep the conversation going, but it was a good conversation and I liked her as a person. She shed a few tiers when telling she had no children and her first husband had died only months after they got married more than ten years ago. She also told me that her second husband had not wanted children and had divorced her three years ago and she seemed quite upset also about that. After lunch, we decided to continue the date by taking a walk in the nearby park. It started raining, however, and she suggested that we go to my place as I lived close by.\n\nAt my place things got awkward. She started kissing me immediately after we got to the livingroom and clearly wanted to have sex. For me, this came completely out of the blue, as she had not given any indication that she would even want to touch me during lunch or our brief walk in the park. And I am not the type of person that would initiate something like that without a clear signal. I kindly stopped her, told her I am not comfortable, and diffused the situation by telling her that I would like to see her again, but we would need to progress at a slower pace. She agreed, although seemed a bit disapointed. We decided on a second date and she left.\n\nAfter the first date I was quite confused. Obviously, I liked that she found me attractive, even though I was not comfortable with the pace. Still, the fact that she would have had sex with me on the first date was a little alarming to me. First of all, I felt it was contrary to almost everything she had stated about her relationship history and goals for future relationships, but maybe I was just being clueless here. Secondly, and more importantly, intimacy is a very meaningful thing to me personally and I would like my partner to share, or at least understand, this sentiment. But the most confusing thing was that, although she was very likeable, attractive enough and on paper she ticked almost all the boxes I could think of, I was not feeling any dicernible infatuation. After some thought, I decided to give the relationship a chance since I thought that I might not ever come across another person with so much potential and who'd be interested in me. Turns out this was my first mistake in all of this.\n\nWe proceeded to go on dates about 2 times a week for the following 6 weeks. The pattern was similar every time: When we were somewhere public she kept a distance, was reluctant to hug and did not want to hold hands for example, but when we were in private, she became almost another person. She was all over me, telling me how much she wanted me and trying to push my boundaries. I can't say I was not aroused, but no romantic feelings had grown on my part and I did not want to go further without those. She, on the other hand, was saying that we were a perfect match and she could not consider any other man in the future etc. She did dump me one time, when I told her I'd like to spend time alone rather than see her one weekend, but then she backtracked the next day. I tried several times to figure out why she thought we were a match made in heaven. On my part, I was coming to the conclusion that despite what she wanted me to believe, we actually had minimal common interests, our expectations for a relationship were not completely aligned and although I thought we had similar values, I could not feel that we were understanding each other on a deeper level. Yet, she managed, time and again, to convince me that there was something there, something that she saw and I just could not yet. And I guess I wanted to believe that as well.\n\nThen, on the 15th date or so, I made a big mistake. I let her convince me to have sex with her on a date at her place. Maybe I was just desperate for sex, afterall, it had been more than seven years since I had been intimate with anyone. But more than that, I think it was me not wanting to let her down again and also thinking this could be the thing that would make the relationship 'click' for me. The sex itself was pretty much how I would have imagined it being for the first time with a new person. Certainly not terrible and I went home feeling okay. What was terrible, was the night and the next morning. I could not sleep, I felt sick, I threw up and I cried. I felt that I had crossed a line that should not have been crossed. I felt disapointed in myself and ashamed. I may need to add that neither of us was drunk (nor even drink for that matter), so it wasn't related to that at all.\n\nWe had already agreed that I'd come over to her place the day after. I did not cancel and went to her place as agreed. Once we had done some cooking, she started making advances again. I told her that I did not want sex this time, I did not mention the vomiting nor the crying, I just told that I was a little emotionally overwhelmed by the previous time. I made sure not to give the impression that the sex was bad or that she was not desirable. Still, she began crying and said something about needing sex. I comforted her and then she, for some reason, broke down completely and told me that she had had a year long relationship with a married man, that had ended a few months prior to meeting me. He had eventually left both her and his wife for a third woman. Prior to this, she had led me to believe that her ex-husband, who had divorced her 3 years ago, was her last relationship. I told her that I understood why she didn't mention the relationship, but that I also felt a bit misled and worried, particularly as we had discussed protection multiple times and she had been very against using a condom. I held her, comforted her and managed to calm her down eventually until leaving back home.\n\nThe next day she texted me that she felt like a whore and told me that she was going to go tested for STIs. I was going on a business trip for the week and told her that she was not a whore but getting tested was a good idea. A few days later she texted me again saying the tests were clean. We arranged a date for the next weekend. But I had started to feel really uneasy about seeing her again.\n\nOn the next date she again wanted to have sex and, although she did not directly pressure me, I felt I could not refuse without hurting her. I guess I also hoped that my previously felt anxiety afterwards would go a way and the sex would become better. She seemed to be enjoying herself immensely and I enjoyed the sounds she made. But the feeling that I got from her, also on other occasions, was that she was not actually interested in me or my body at all. She wanted me to pleasure her, but also was not giving me anything to work with even when I tried to probe what would make her feel great. She also felt super insecure about her body, was really reluctant on me going down on her and made sure the room was as dark as possible. Probably as no surprise to you, my anxiety and moral hangover also returned the next night. Not quite as bad, but still awful.\n\nWe had a couple of more similar dates with me growing exceedingly reluctant to see her but still unable to put a stop to it and call things off. This was partly because I still wanted to believe in some miracle that would make the relationship work. But mostly it was because I had had sex with her and I now felt obligated to continue the relationship lest I be an asshole. Somehow, I also felt, based on remarks she made, that that was something she had actually aimed for to keep me in this relationship. I still continued to express my concern that we had ultimately very little common interests, she had no friends nor hobbies really, which was not a problem for me in itself, but she wanted me to be 'her life' and that was something I could not offer even if I wanted to. I had also very early told her that I do not want a relationship based on just sex and I felt that it was becoming clear that it was where we were. Everytime she brushed things aside and told me she thought everything was fine.\n\nAt some point it really struck me that this was not the kind of relationship I wanted. I would rather be alone than in a relationship out of obligation or fear or without emotional intimacy and romantic feelings. Finally, a couple of months ago, I broke up with her. I did it by texting her. I am not proud of that, but that was our primary way of communicating when not together, and she had told me that she had been violent with her ex-husband and I feared a physical altercation if I told her in person. She had become slightly aggressive towards me multiple times when things had not gone the way she liked. Particularly, when she knew that I was free, but I had chosen not to spend my time with her but rather on my own.\n\nShe was surprised and upset. Understandably so. She claimed she had not noticed anything being wrong and thought that I had had a great time with her. She asked me questions why I did not want to continue and I answered in the most polite and kind way I could. Basically, it was me telling her the same concerns about not having a connection, the relationship was ultimately solely based on her wanting to have sex with me and me hoping that I would grow affection towards her. Then there was a pause and after a few day she started sending very explicit sexual texts. She told me how much she missed my dick, sex with me and how good I was at it. Can't say I would not be ecstatic about those kind of messages under different circumstances. Now, I just told her that I appreciated how she felt, but I still wasn't interested in continuing. Then she accused me of taking advantage of her, essentially a pump and dump. Finally, she started sending very aggressive texts telling me that she was the best woman I could get in a somewhat berating and snarky way. After two weeks of texts several times a day, she finally stopped once I was very blunt with the reasons I had broken up and how I had felt during the relationship.\n\nI am not quite sure why I am writing this here, maybe I am hoping this will bring some closure for me as I have been having horrible nightmares about the whole thing. Particularly, I feared that she lied about contraception and will show up with a baby in nine months time. Rationally, I know that even if she lied, it would be extremely unlikely for her to get pregnant at her age with the limited amount of times we actually had intercourse. We also had lengthy discussions on the subject and I do not really believe she lied. Still, the doubt is there poisoning my subconscious mind.\n\nNow, maybe it is right for me to suffer as I know I was the asshole here. I probably hurt her deeply by letting her dreams first grow and then destroying them. I should have known better. Even if she knew all the time what she was doing, I should have stopped seeing her after a few weeks when I had not grown any affection for her. But... I've always hated the notion of 'the spark' and wanted to believe affection can grown. Now I know that is not true. I feel so stupid.\n\nI also feel very broken, I think I can heal, but this is how I now feel: I feel like having lost something that I had, something that I could give or provide to the person I truly want to be with. That something is now gone, possibly forever, and this mistake of a relationship will be a stain on any future relationship I might want to have. At the moment, I certainly do not feel like letting anyone close to me because I can not possibly trust anyone. At least to the extent I would need to, to form an intimate relationship with them. I think this is because I now know, that I can't trust even myself to do the right thing: Not to hurt myself or the other party. My worst fear (aside from having an unwanted child) would be just the thing I did to her: I gave her a chance, let her believe she had met the man of her dreams and secured him, just for me to pull the rug under her feet. If I can't trust myself not to do that, I can't trust anyone not to do that to me.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read all of this. I am quite at a loss in what to think of it myself. Feel free to express your thoughts, but please be kind.\n\n**TLDR;** Divorced, wanted to start dating. Had literally no success for months. Contacted by woman who seemed like a rational choice. Could not grow affection but still let the relationship go too far in the hope of it all somehow working out while she was madly in love all the way. Eventually hurt her and hurt myself.

It started really well and I really thought that I found my person, he was everything I always looked for in a partner and I was so happy. He was so loving and he always wanted to spend time together. Around the 4/5th month of relationship I started to realize I was in love with him so I told him and when I did we made love right after I said \"I love you\" so the day after I asked him what that ment and he said \"I have feelings for you, it's just difficult for me to express it through worlds\". So I spent the following month thinking he loved me, but it was difficult for him to say it and I've never doubted the fact that he loved me cause he did everything else to make me feel loved.\nBut during those months he was more detached, he was less sweet and he didn't really initiate things with me (he wasn't inviting me at his place unless I said things like \"what if we spend the night together?\"). I always asked him if there was something wrong but he always had an excuse: work, family things, his shoulder bothering him etc.\nThe last straw for me was when he went away for two weeks and even after I asked him to please say sweet things to me (I would have been happy with a \"a care about you\" \"I adore you\" or \"I miss you\") and he didn't. When he come back home I wanted to talk about this and the conversation ended with him saying \"I don't know if I love you, you're perfect, everything I always wanted, but I'm not sure I'm in love, I was thinking about it for months and I still haven't found a answer. Give me a little time to think about it and when I'll understand my feelings I'll call you\". I was devastated, but I was so in love with him that I was OK with this. Not even 24 hours later he contacted me saying he loved me, he missed me so much and there are so many things he wants to do with me and he wants me in his life. I was so happy. He wanted to go to pick up his new dog together kinda to show me I was important for him. He spent the next two weeks saying he loves me, calling me love, honey etc, looking for me, making me meet his cousins etc. Then one Sunday I asked him if he sees a future with me (I asked because the day before he talked about kids and he never did it before) and he's exact words were \"we wouldn't be here if I didn't want you in my future\". I was so relieved and happy to hear those words from him....but 2 days later I receive a long ass message from him explaining that he didn't loved me, that when I asked him about a future with me he started thinking if he really wanted it or not, that I was really important to him, but it wasn't fair to make me stay in this relationship and that I deserved better.\nI feel betrayed...the thing that hurt the most is the fact that I explicitly told him to not come back unless he was sure about his feelings and he did. I'm don't even know how to feel about this, I'm mad, but I'm mostly disappointed. I need to see him in two days cause he needs to give me my dig carrier back since I give it to him when we went to pick up his dog and he didn't even propose to bring it back. We don't really use it so it took me days to realize he still had it and even if I know he use it at least twice a day I had to be the one to ask if he could bring it back. \nAll of this feels so immature to me, I mean his almost 30 and he didn't had the courage to have a conversation to brake up...\nI don't even know how to behave when I'll see him, cause part of me is numb about this story and the other part is so raged that I'd want to yell at him...", "created_utc": 1758442142.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nmm9k7/i_feel_like_my_bf_played_me/", "score": 6, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

So I met this dude on tinder right after I had gotten out of an 8 month relationship. For background I was 19F (20 now) and bi. This guy was 21 and straight. I had vowed to myself I’d never date a cishet person. As long as they’re some form of queer (could be a cis guy and bi) that’s all good. Straight cis men just give me the ickiest of icks ever. However, in terms of hooking up, I don’t rly have any “requirements” for lack of a better term for sexuality/gender with that. \n\nMy previous relationship was non-sexual for reasons I won’t disclose, and I am a very sexual person, so this ended up not working. After we broke up, I was very touch starved and just needed something so I went to dating apps to just find hook ups.\n\nOnto this guy. We’re gonna call him “cop guy” since that’s what my friends all call him (he was in school to become a cop or smth? Idk lol) We went on a date where we walked around the city for a long time and got ice cream. We ended up kissing and decided to go back to his place. So he lives in a hotel. It turns out said hotel happens to also be a dorm for some colleges as well. Idk. Anyway we, you know, do some stuff in his room and I stayed the night. (I made it very clear to him from the beginning that I was not looking for a relationship or smth serious bc I had just gotten out of one and he was okay with this)\n\nWent home the next morning and was interested in seeing him again to have some fun. We ended up seeing each other about every other day the next week. On about day 3/4 of us seeing each other he tells me he told his mom DETAILS about what we did. (Specifically he told her how good I was at giving h34d). UM. Idk why I didn’t run there.\n\nYou think this is it? Girl we’re not even close to halfway through this story.\n\nWe get drunk (I bought the alc) and he tells me he loves me (mind you we MET less than a week ago) and I was pretty drunk and I’ll be honest due to the touch deprivation my body was really fucking with me and my emotions and I “thought” I felt things that I didn’t because I was getting attention in that way for the first time in a WHILE. Anyway so I say it back but I was CONFUSED. Again he knows this. Whatever. When I had sobered up I tell him I think I was confused bc of the reasons I listed above. He tells me he wants to become “Facebook official”. Huh? I say “ok that’s fine but if it’s ok I don’t want it to show up on my account.” He says that’s totally chill and does it on his end. I thought I had to do it myself to make it show up for me but apparently it just is public if the other person adds you. I got a call from my mom being like “hey I see you’re in a relationship?” I literally sigh and say “I thought you couldn’t see that”. News flash girl if this is your reaction to this this is not a relationship to be in 😭\n\nAnyway. “Cop guy”’s mom follows me on Facebook. I had a performance coming up and she reposted it everywhere to all her family and friends. (Also, there was an option to purchase livestream tickets for this performance and to tip certain performers beforehand. Apparently his mom tipped me $50 😭)\n\nOk so on to the weekend. This is exactly one week after we had met. We had planned for me to spend the whole weekend there. That did not go as planned. We went on a dinner date to Applebee’s where I paid. Then we went back and had some drinks (there was leftover that I bought from the last week). He had this thing he liked to do where he would kiss me with the alcohol in his mouth and then SPIT IT INTO MY MOUTH. ew. Anyway long story short I end up getting SEVERELY overstimulated and I was kinda panicking. I let him know this and he understood. I decide to stay the night again Saturday bc I felt bad but I left much earlier the next day than originally planned. During the night I told him I needed some space physically due to overstimulation and he said he totally understood. He KEPT TOUCHING ME during the night. In a dorm bed I am absolutely aware there’s not a lot of room. That wasn’t what I was upset about. It was that he kept touching me specifically on my lower back where he knows also triggers my fight or flight response. Not just this but when I flinched he started going on like “oh my goddddd I’m so bad I’m so bad I’m sorryyyyyy” so now I’m not allowed to feel what I’m feeling and I have to reassure his goddamned feelings instead now.\n\nI end up getting home and I’m like you know what this is gonna go away I’m just overstimulated from not having a lot of physical contact in a while. it never went away. During the next week I’m busy and we aren’t able to see each other during the week. While I’m in my calculus class I see a Facebook notification. His mom had tagged me in a post. Guess what it is. It’s a picture of a letter he wrote to his FUTURE WIFE WHEN HE WAS 14. ME TAGGED FRONT AND CENTRE. BITCH WTFFF. Yes I should have run right then and there. Yes I was being stupid. And then during my singing class the next day I put my phone on do not disturb so as to not have it going off in class, naturally. When the class is over, I open my phone to a BUNCH of messages from “cop guy”. He was freaking out about why my phone was on do not disturb. I can’t remember everything he said but he was like “why is your phone on dnd? What’s going on I’m kinda freaking out rn” really odd.\n\nThat Friday we had planned for me to spend the weekend there once again. The Friday comes around and I wasn’t feeling any different than how I did at the end of the last weekend. I talk to my roommate (let’s call them A, who was also my ex that I was in said 8 month relationship with) about it since we were super chill and on friendly terms (yes it’s possible, yes it’s been a year now and nothing has changed they’re awesome). I started telling A the story of what had happened up to that point with “cop guy”. They’re staring at me and said GIRL RUN. Upon hearing the story out loud speaking it, I’m finally seeing all the red flags. A helps me form a plan to let “cop guy” down gently. I tell A I still want to go in person as I would never “break up” or let someone I was involved with down over text or phone unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY as I had been through through that before on the other end and don’t wish that on my worst enemy.\n\nAnyway I show up. “Cop guy” meets me downstairs, tries to kiss me and I dodge it. I say “can we talk” and he looks flustered and says “uh yeah”. We get in the elevator and he’s like “should I be worried? Should I be worried?” And I’m just politely trying to say “can we please get to the room first”. We get to his room and we sit next to each other on the bed bc there was nowhere else to sit. I start trying to explain myself and try to gently let him down. I explain that I was very confused especially with how I had just gotten out a long relationship and that things were going way too fast and I wasn’t comfortable with it. He was like “oh we can go back to no labels if you want” so I had to pivot and kept trying to find ways to be like “I just don’t see this working, I need space, this is too much”, etc etc. again he always responded with “we can do no labels if you want”. DUDE NO. so eventually I have to get a bit sterner since he’s not getting it. I say “I just don’t see us working out in the long run” he starts going “no no no noooo don’t say that” (and this whole time he’s been touching me when I very clearly did not reciprocate) and while he’s saying this he gropes at my arm and forces my head onto his shoulder. And I keep going with what I’m saying bc I want to get tf out of there. He’s slowly realizing what I mean now and saying “well if you could AT LEAST spend the night” - girl I don’t owe you shit. And he also said “my heart is telling me not to let you walk out that door” - creepy much? At some point he says “well we can take a week and not talk to each other and then reconvene” (half the amount time we knew each other lol) and at that point I was so desperate and feeling a panic attack coming on so I just needed to get out of there. I said sure and got out.\n\nPart 2\n\nSo. The weekend is fairly calm. However, on Sunday I check my Instagram and lo and behold “cop guy”  was posting. Out of curiosity I opened his story. There was a TON of relationship posts he had put up on his story. Two of the ones that stuck out to me were “you can drink as much as you want but you’ll never forget the sound of her laugh” and “sometimes you can love someone so much that people will think you’re crazy”. And he kept posting. And I know he saw I viewed them bc I was the first to view out of curiosity. The final straw was him posting on his TikTok story. It was a picture of his desk with the alcohol that I HAD BOUGHT for us and a caption he wrote that went: “ending the weekend the way it started when she walked out that door” and I was like oh hell no. I go to A. I show A said posts and am like wtf do I do. A helps me form a plan to FaceTime “cop guy” to end things officially once and for all. A asked if i wanted them to be in the room for support. I said yes please. I get on the phone. “Cop guy” is very clearly intoxicated. I’m like hey wtf were those stories I don’t feel comfortable with them and it feels like you’re trying to guilt trip me and he starts going on about how he had “no idea I was viewing those stories” and some bullshit. I’m trying very hard to finally end things but he keeps cutting in and talking so slow that there’s not really a way to cut in. And when I do talk he finds a way to twist it in his way or whatever and he’s just not letting me end things. Eventually A asks me to mute my mic and I do. A says “do you want me to do it for you” and at this point I’m so fed up and have been trying and I say “yes grab my phone while I’m talking and do it” - what this a mistake? Yes. Do I regret it? No. However, A grabs my phone and goes “YOU’RE A FUCKING CREEP AND SHES BLOCKING YOU” and hangs up and blocks him. I was like ok well maybe don’t say that. Anyway we block “cop guy” and go watch that gay Pinocchio movie to get our minds off things. “Cop guy” is trying every platform to try to get to me before I block him there.\n\nOh did you think it was over yet? Think again.\n\nLater that night I unblock him on FB one final time just to tell him on my terms that I didn’t necessarily agree with what A said but that whatever we had going was unhealthy and I think it’s best for us to go our separate ways. He starts blowing up and ranting about A and about how he was “only trying to give me was A couldn’t” and I said wtf that’s still my friend and you’re spending your last moments with me complaining abt my ex? He said you’re right sorry sorry and that I was a wonderful experience. I said bye and blocked him finally.\n\nThere is more to the story, but I might have to post an update with it since this is already insane.", "created_utc": 1758433810.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nmk0sz/ex_breaks_up_with_my_relationship_for_me_smosh/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmjalj", "subreddit": "TrueOffMyChest", "title": "I don't want a future.", "selftext": "Writing this from a burner account. I (17M) don't want a future. I'm not sure what else to say, but I'll give some backstory as to why I feel this way. I've never really had a childhood. I lost my dad when I was only 9, and my mother (Then 43F) and I had to grow up incredibly fast. I was home alone pretty much all day. I had to take care of myself for the past 8 years, and now that college is coming up, I kinda just am at an impasse. I've always questioned my existence. I've never really felt like I belonged. I didn't really have friends (still don't), don't go out much, never really experienced love. When I was younger, my parents kinda just acted like I didn't exist in a way where they focused on the version of me in their head. In other words, there are two me's, one that exists in my moms head and used to live in my dads, and the actual me.   \n  \nI feel like sometimes I was born just to be an example. Moving back to the point, I just feel like I believe my future isn't something I want. I literally cannot imagine living another 50 years of my life. I've tried to tell myself it's depression, it's just a phase, I'll get over it, but no matter what happens, no matter how many passions I find, no matter what I do, I just feel like I'll never really want it. I literally cannot fathom what would be appealing about living through more of this. I'm not in a bad situation, either. We live a decent life, I'm not poor by any means. I get 3 meals a day, I don't have to worry about food, water, shelter, any of it, and I have 'friends'. But that's the worst part. I feel like I don't deserve any of it. People always say \"oh, you've gone through so much, you've done so much work, don't be like that,\" but it's literally the fact that I do not want to do the work. I have a 3.8 GPA, I'm taking AP level coursework, I'm an artistically gifted kid, but I couldn't care less about any of it. I would rather curl into a ball, never leave my room, and never see anyone ever again. I hate social obligations, I hate feeling like people only talk to me because they feel bad, I hate people having to work and worry just because of my existence. Also, I'm not bragging because I truly don't believe I deserve my talent either. I feel like it was just given to me, and I don't deserve it. I don't want to use it because that'd be work, and all the work I've done is just paying my dues for being said burden.\n\nAnother thing is regret. I don't regret too much now, but I know I will in the future. I have so many interests. I want to go into neuroscience, but also astronomy, but also architecture, or finance, or graphic design and something artistic. I'll live my entire life regretting I couldn't do all of this. I don't want to live my life knowing I'll regret doing the thing that I had to give up everything else for. It's such a problem because that would be my only reason for a future, and I won't get to live my future the way I'd like to. it really sucks man.\n\nI don't want to experience more life than this.", "created_utc": 1758431176.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nmjalj/i_dont_want_a_future/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false}

Maybe it all started with my physical appearance since I’ve always been a little more fragile due to being very underweight and having a naive look in my eyes that never really went away. Recently my psychiatrist I started going to last year told me that my parents had contact him 15 years ago for being worried about my behavior, they told him I would give my favorite toys to my friends im kindergarten among other similar situations, and after telling me this he said I didn’t change much, it broke me to hear that.\n\nI don’t remember much about my childhood, I don’t even know who I am and who I used be, but I do remember how it felt to be fragile, so shy, sensitive kid, it felt lonely, I felt so small, I was a wreck always craving something special to happen while I’d stand there quiet and scared. I started hating my looks at around 5/6 years old, I’ve always been visibly different for being so underweight, I was healthy while looking malnourished, it’s genetics. Ofc I’ve been bullied for that my whole life, but everyone’s been bullied at some point, why am I like this? \n\nI was diagnosed with adhd last year, now I know why I felt so disconnected from people as a child, I always thought I was a failure and dumb because I struggled at school, never got good grades, couldn’t pay attention and lived inside my thoughts most of the time. Yet my teachers, parents and any other adult in my life would brush it off telling me I was some kind of special brilliant kid for being extremely talented at drawing, I was to obedient and too quiet to have adhd, “all artists suffer” and I believed for so many years that I had something deeply special inside my heart, that I would be as big as my dad who’s a successful actor and also talented at drawing. He was my role model, he was my whole view on life, all I ever wanted was to be like him, because I was also special for being his daughter.\n\nThe thought of carrying something special in me is still here, I feel pathetic for having such a childish belief. When I got into art high school I realized I wasn’t the only one who could draw, some people were even more talented than me. So now what’s am I going the yearn for to not despise myself? I decided to keep believing my pain and heritage were what made me be someone big, not superior, but known and loved for my own weirdness, turning my deep flaws into something beautiful.\n\nI don’t remember when this happened, but I was so shy I almost didn’t talk as a child, but something changed one day, suddenly, while still being shy, I came to terms to the fact that I was very ugly and unfit for any kind of affection, so I started being loud, making people laugh at my jokes, begging for attention with oversharing badly disguised as a joke. Suddenly I was loud and angry, I started humiliating myself for attention, saying shocking things and gossiping too much. I started being a really awful person when my craving for attention got to an extreme, to the point of straight up telling everyone I was going to kill myself, self harming for attention during class and manipulating people into thinking I was so helpless and miserable for an extreme amount of attention that somehow was never enough. \n\nNow I still crave attention, I still have an oversharing problem and I feel so guilty for hurting so many people just because I wanted attention when I was 14, I’m ashamed forever.\n\nLately my inner monologue’s been draining, it’s telling me everyone hates me, that im a bad person and every move I make is something I should be ashamed of, so I always assume everyone hates me as a standard and I’m the one who has to prove them im good, but I’m never good. I think I’m an ugly, flawed beast, that’s why I don’t look people in the eyes or try to flirt with anyone, I don’t deserve good things, im unfit. \n\nI hate myself so much, nothing I do is good, im flawed. So yesterday something I thought I would never happen happened, a stranger showed interest in me when I was out at night, I used to think I was way too ugly for anyone to find me attractive, but that guy listened to me drunk telling him how much of a terrible person I am and how much I hate living, he said I was intelligent, said he saw in my eyes that I gave up on life a long time ago, I wasn’t interested in him at all, I just kept talking because I never felt like anyone would think those things about me, I felt special. That’s how I let it happen, I let him hold my hand and he started touching me in weird ways, not too weird, but I was super uncomfortable, I couldn’t say no to him, I just froze and let it happen until a friend helped me get an excuse to leave, Im a lesbian, I didn’t feel anything for him, yet I led him on to feel worthy and good about myself and I hated it, I feel filthy, it was disgusting.\n\nWhy do I do anything to feel worthy of something, why do I hate myself so deeply.

I met him in my second month of university. He was my third kiss, my first time and my first ever relationship. I have pretty much no other relationship experience than him, and he has had a few relationships in the past.\n\nThis June we have moved in together, and since then I have been plagued with doubts about our relationship, whether this is what I really want, and whether I have settled too quickly. As far as he is concerned, I am his soulmate, he wants to spend the rest of our lives together and he doesn't really have any long-term goals or ambitions outside of our relationship. As much as I hate to admit it I don't really have similar feelings about our relationship right now. This may be due to the fact I have experienced a lot of change recently - I graduated university in July and I am experiencing somewhat of a post-graduation 'slump' of sorts which I am seeking help for. Not to mention, I have moved in with him which is a huge change as I am used to having a lot of my own time to be alone.\n\n I have certain career goals and ambitions that will have me relocate to hours away or even overseas. He says he would come with me because he doesn't want to be apart from me but I'm really not comfortable with that. The idea of bringing him to a completely new place that I know he won't particularly like, where he knows nobody and where his life will get smaller to essentially revolve mainly around me fills me with dread and panic. I have recently communicated this with him and he clearly isn't happy with the idea and doesn't really understand but he would let me do it.\n\nI also really have not been feeling the spark I once used to feel with him. I know it's natural to have the 'honeymoon period' end and it throws you through a loop, which is what I am currently feeling. I used to feel so infatuated and wanted to spend all of my time with him, and would've sacrificed anything to be with him. At the moment, I feel like I am living with a best friend who I love, but I am not feeling IN love with. He is trying so hard to make it work by doing dates/other romantic things and cheering me up, and I want to devote myself to doing the same to try and make it work but I'm just not really feeling it and I don't know why. I am constantly plagued with thoughts of wanting to be single again, being totally free to do what I want, and thoughts of having relations with other people - nobody specific, just..people. He's not done anything wrong, I don't feel neglected, I just feel different about us.\n\nPart of me wants these feelings to go away and to make it work so I can be happy with him again, but another part of thinks I might be doing that because I want to delay the inevitable of breaking his heart. The unknown of whether I would ever find another person who loves me and gets along with me as well as he does also weighs on me, but forcing myself to stay with him due to that fear is a disservice to him and myself if I am still not happy.\n\nI am in the process of seeking help with my GP to try and process these feelings with a professional but it's taking a while. I feel so lost and confused. I care so very deeply for him, and I do still have fun moments with him, I am just not feeling any passion or romance at all even though I am trying to. The thought of hurting him and breaking his heart pains me deeply but I worry it may be inevitable. Part of me thing if I had another year or two of singlehood before getting with him I wouldn't be having any doubts right now. But because he is the only romantic relationship I have ever known, I keep thinking about what or who else there could be out there for me. I don't want to settle and resent myself and him  in years time.\n\nI am feeling so conflicted right now, and any advice or reassurance that I am not alone would be helpful.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758471770.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmwbs7/i_am_having_doubts_about_my_relationship_with_my/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmvelg", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Should I tell my mom I think my sister's stealing?", "selftext": "TL;DR: My sister makes our living situation miserable and I've excused her behaviour thus far, but I've discovered I'm missing money that only she was able and capable of taking.\n\nSorry for the long post, I'm just trying to explain the dynamic and the situation has finally reached it's boiling point.\n\nI'm still in college and I live with my sisters, one is 5 and the other is 10 years older. Our parents live in the apartment under us, but dad works out of the country so he isn't home often.\n\nMy older sister is very difficult to live with, she'll cause scenes over the most minor things, you have to walk on eggshells around her, she doesn't respond well to any criticism and she reacts abruptly to all of it. She makes lunch and you tell her it's a bit too salty and she gets mad and says she's never making lunch again. She'll never apologize for anything or admit to any wrongdoing or inappropriate reaction. So you have to stay calm, but it piles up and when we finally tell her something about it, she says we're ganging up on her and gets mad and won't speak to us for months at a time, making the living situation unbearable. She'll sit in the living room for days since she works from home so I have to resort to staying in my room for months at a time when she's mad. She gets mad when we're missing milk, eggs or toilet paper, but she'll never go and get it herself.\n\nHer relationship with our parents is very strenuous because they had her at a very young age and they weren't the best parents to her. They have apologized to her profusely about that and tried to make it right. She hasn't forgiven them and that's fine, she doesn't have to love them, but she doesn't respect them in the slightest. They let her live in their house for free, they let her start her business on their home address, mom makes lunch for all of us every day, her included, they have paid of her debts, gotten her a car, helped her when she had it hard. She often says they have never done anything for her which is a blatant lie. I don't know if she actually believes it or is so delusional. When we call her out on ultimately being ungrateful, she flips out. She has cried over their relationships, they definitely have been assholes at times, but the amount of disrespect after everything they've ultimately done for her is too much IMO.\n\nIt has come out recently that she's lied about a lot of stuff, her work and other stuff and she's said that to random people that have then told that to us. She's had money problems and instead of coming to us, she mentions that to other people, then they mention it to us and we look like fools because we live with her and don't know anything, but people she sees twice a year know it. When we fight, she tells the most disgusting things, like she hopes we drop dead, that we should be locked up in a mental institution etc., but still brings up me calling her crazy once when I was 15. She got mad the other day because I told her that the way she closes the blinds lets more sunlight in.\n\nYesterday, our other sister said she's going out to the store and asked her to fold the towels from the dryer. She said she won't and that she doesn't care. We obviously got mad because she does barely any chores, she washes only her own clothes when we wash everything and she cleans one bathroom, not thouroughly and not often. Her room is a mess, she'll sometimes sleep without sheets on because she's too lazy to put them on. She said she was joking about the towels, but because we flipped out, she won't fold them, but just throw them on the floor and she won't do any chores anymore now. We're again not talking now.\n\nNow for the money. I have a kiddy wallet buried in a drawer in my room where I collected the money I got from relatives, on birthdays and such. I forgot about it and found it two years ago when I did a huge deep clean in my room. I mentioned it to my family how I saved up a nice amount and didn't even know it. I had hundreds of euros, some US dollars, pounds, swiss money, a bit of everything. As a broke college student, I started taking money from it, but very rarely, only when I needed it. A few months ago, I realised I've run out of euros and was surprised, but thought I just didn't realise I took it all. Few months later, after another \"big\" fight, my other sister says she had some money missing, and then about a week ago, she took my sister's change which was about 30 euros that she left on the living room shelf. Even if she didn't know it was hers, you can't take the money if you know it isn't yours.\n\nI realised that more was missing than just euros, so I wrote down how much money exactly I have and put in another 40 euros in. I looked at the wallet yesterday and I'm missing the 40 euros, 50 dollars and 50 pounds. I also have a box where I collect different world currencies. It has one side different from the others and I always have it with that side facing the room. I saw it was turned the wrong way and the euros from it were missing. She's the only one capable of doing it and since she works from home, she's alone every morning at home.\n\nShe's my sister and I love her, but through her behaviour, I can see she has no feelings towards any of us. We told her that yesterday and she didn't deny it, she just scoffed. I'm at work now and I'm sick to my stomach because I have to get home where she is after work. It creates so much stress for me. I love her and care about her deeply and despite my miserable pay, if she asked, I would've given her the money without expecting her to pay me back. However, with the amount of stress she's given me, I can't wait for her to somehow move away and I never have to see her again. I feel guilty that I fantasize about that. Important to note that neither her nor any of us have means to move. \n\nI won't tell my dad about the missing money because I'm afraid he'll kick her out or something so I'm contemplating just telling mom, but I think that'll ruin her, but I don't know what else to do. \n\nHelp please.", "created_utc": 1758469616.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmvelg/should_i_tell_my_mom_i_think_my_sisters_stealing/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

I feel completely lost, full of guilt, and I can’t process how I’ll move forward. She was truly the most important person in my life.\n\nThe guilt is killing me because there were big issues I never handled properly or at the right time. I guess I was just too immature emotionally, avoiding the real talks and hoping things would magically work out.\n\nThe first big issue: she doesn’t want kids, and I do. I’m 30 and always imagined having my first child around 33. Deep down, I kept believing she would change her mind once we were married, that she was just overthinking, and that things would eventually be different. But instead of actually talking about it openly, I just ignored it. That was so immature of me, and I regret it deeply.\n\nThe second issue: I’m religious (in a normal, day-to-day way), and she isn’t. A lot of my values and actions are influenced by my faith, while she made it clear she doesn’t share that. Once again, I fell into the same pattern—I told myself we’d find balance later, without really sitting down and discussing it like adults, and I rushed into planning marriage without addressing it.\n\non a daily life, we were super good, full of laughs and discussions , never felt bored at all , it was trully magical, and deep down i didn’t want to lose her at all,  i do admit but i did try one time talk about it way before but she was too rude and defensive and i felt i hurt her questioning it and talking about it but i did never try again at all and i have been a coward.\n\nAlso, i have huge empathy towards her, she has a lot of childhood trauma, and have a lot of familly problems on a daily basis, so i tried my best to not hurt her and just to provide safety and confort instead of being another source of hurt also.\n\nim not a bad person, i trully wanted to make it work without hurting her at all, but now I feel like I crushed her instead of protecting her, and I carry this huge weight of guilt and shame.\n\nI crushed her, hurt her, and wasted her time, and this make me sick of myself.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758469231.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmv8i9/broke_up_with_my_gf_after_5_years_just_weeks/", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

Her experience was awful. \n\nI’m talking a lack of professionalism via showing up late and ending early, the therapist didn’t seem to have experience with what she needed help with (even though she claimed she specialized in it). In the end she just became condescending when my wife asked to work on what she went to the sessions for. She claimed we were codependent because I help her remember to do breathing exercises when she’s upset, and the whole point of therapy was that we wanted her to get to a point where she remembers to start doing it on her own. We know it’s a problem but this therapist just couldn’t seem to grasp that and ended up just soap boxing at her for the last ten minutes of her session about “healthy relationships” and “independence” or something. \n\nI don’t think our relationship is unhealthy is the thing. We do talk through our problems. We support one another’s personal goals and aspirations. I just don’t think supporting someone when they are upset is actually that bad a thing to do, and I don’t get what the obsession with suffering alone is. It’s not more virtuous than seeking support.

So I thought...why not share my story? My love life (which I’ve basically given up on) might not be exciting, but it’s real.\n\nBefore anyone judges, let me say this upfront: I know I need therapy. I just can’t afford it right now.\n\nI come from a Muslim neighborhood where dating and hooking up are considered taboo. So I never had a relationship, since I was busy studying hard to get into a decent university and build a solid future for myself......until I got married.(Something like an arranged marriage)\nIt was a mistake. A toxic one.  \nI put everything I had into getting divorced, and if you know anything about Muslim countries, you know that process can take forever. Mine took over two years.\n\nSince then, I’ve been focusing on work and family. I want to grow, become independent, and eventually move out.  \nAnd here’s the thing: I’ve realized relationships might not be for me. Or I might not be for relationships 😅\n\nAt first, I was like: “NOPE. No marriage. Not doing that again.”  \nBut after a while, I decided to give men a chance (no offense).  \nI tried dating apps. Talked to some foreigners—they were actually nice. Maybe genuinely nice, maybe just pretending.  \nStill, I got bored and deleted the apps within a week or two.  \nEspecially when I tried “fishing in the sea of my own country”…  \nLet’s just say: disaster.  \nMost of the men only wanted to hook up. A few wanted marriage—which I don’t.  \nAnd almost all of them were… well, messed up. Bad habits, bad attitudes, bad jobs.\n\nEven when I found someone who seemed decent, I realized I’m not the one. He was way too clingy, and I was already overwhelmed, trying to support my family and manage my job.  \nWhen I finally decided to accept him as my boyfriend, my body literally reacted. I felt sick.  \nI apologized and told him I couldn’t continue, but he got mad and said, “You’re just like the others! Everyone keeps turning me down…” \n😐ʘ⁠‿⁠ʘ\n\nSo here’s why I don’t want marriage or dating anymore:\n\n- Most couples I know are unhappy (because of the man)  \n- Marriage feels like a prison for women  \n- My father doesn’t respect my mom, and my ex didn’t respect me either—I know this cycle would repeat  \n- Nobody seems honest.

Please skip this post if you cannot endure emotional turmoil.\n\nToday, when most people are busy performing rituals for their ancestors blessings and praying for their salvation, my heart recalls an old school friend. Her name was Preity Bhatia. Initially, we were never close, never sat on the same bench. Then one day, we realized that we shared same neighborhood. Stayovers began, awkwardness blurred and we became good friends.\n\nOn my birthday, she gave me a letter pad that had the word \"captivating\" embossed on the cover. She cheerfully shouted 'happy birthday' in the class, embraced me tightly and with that goofy gesture, she stole the title of best-friend in my life.\n\nShe was extremely fair, green eyes, silky reddish brown hair. Though we were in the 8th standard, she always had an interest in her mother's hair-dyes. One day during my stayover at her place, she ended up putting mehndi on her hair. Her goofy eyes were a sight to behold when she noticed the reddish tint in her hair. I laughed so hard, literally fell to the floor and she followed suit. Giggling and it was just happy tears how her thrilling 'try out' failed so epically. We were inseparable, two loony cartoons.\n\nMy family and I went to Punjab for summer holidays. After two months, when we came back, everything in the air had shifted. An absolute calm before the storm.\n\nI called her place and her mother said she couldn't come to the phone. I let it slide. A week later, I visited her home to surprise her, carrying chocolates, flowers and heavily embroidered suits (that i had bought for her from Punjab). Her mother did not allow me to enter. She told me Preity had a fever. Although a bit gloomy, i turned back, thinking tomorrow would be another day to spoil her with gifts. As I crossed the road to reach my ride, I heard her scream. I looked back and she shouted my name at the top of her lungs. At the exact moment, i saw her father pushing her down the stairs. All the gifts spilled out of my hands and i ran back towards her home. I climbed the iron gate, ignoring her mother's shouts. My father was rushing behind me, and her father pushed me hard across the floor. What i witnessed was a horrifying scene, she was profusely bleeding, her hair ruffled and she sported a short haircut. I couldn't understand what was going on. All i could feel was my mother's tight embrace as she pulled me away. My mother quickly put me in the car and locked doors. I was numb. Next thing i knew our parents were arguing and their neighbors joined in. The p0lice arrived and her parents reluctantly took her to hospital.\n\nAfter that fiasco, it took my parents three days to tell me that my friend had passed away. The push which i had witnessed actually caused her to lose her life. I did not believe it, called her father, he hung up. I carried a heavy heart filled with so many unanswered questions, her scream scarred in my soul as probably that was the last word to come outta her mouth. I fainted, suffered a bout of fever for days. My parents took me on an impromptu vacation.\n\nAfter three weeks when i joined back, school kids revealed the full story. She had met a guy and he used to drop her off at her house. Her parents had caught them eating pastries at nearby market. Instead of sorting the issue in any parental/reasonable way, they had started beating her, chopped her hair while she slept and stopped her from stepping out. It breaks my heart to even think about how miserable she must have been during her last days. She was an only child then why were her parents so rigid? Why such an aggressive approach towards a girl having her first boyfriend? People conveniently say that such outrageous behavior is more common in lower class families, but that's not true. People can be equally violent behind closed doors irrespective of societal status.\n\nMy friend was full of life, love and inexplicable warmth. Her absence left a significant scar on my mind.\n\nMay her soul rest peacefully!💐🥀\n\nToday, I pray salvation for a vivacious vibrant spirit who deserved the world.❤️", "created_utc": 1758464309.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmt6dw/scar_i_carry_in_my_heart/", "score": 4, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmsygw", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "At my grandfather’s funeral, I met my father’s secret daughter.", "selftext": "It’s been almost ten years since that day, and I still don’t have answers. The questions just keep piling up every year. I’m 20 now, and my relationship with my parents is good. But it wasn’t always like that.\n\nI grew up in a family that was a little unusual for my region. My mom worked, and my dad, because of health issues, became a stay-at-home parent and mostly raised me. I never thought there was anything “wrong” with that. My childhood was happy. But when my teenage years started, everything got heavy.\n\nI was 12 when we all knew my grandfather was dying. It was hard to watch, especially as a kid. One morning, my grandma called. That was strange - she never called in the mornings. And right away I felt something bad was about to happen. My dad is from another country, so we didn’t see his side of the family as much as my mom’s. Plus, they were always in conflict, so I thought maybe this was just another fight. But no. Something was different. I remember us driving to the countryside house in complete silence. No music, no talking. Just silence. Nobody told me anything. I could see something was going on, but whenever I asked, they brushed me off - “we’re just tired.” I remember lying on a blanket with my friend and telling her, “I think my grandpa died…” She tried to calm me down, saying it was just a coincidence, that everything was fine. But I knew. I felt it.  Neither of my parents said a word. But to me, it was obvious. And I was boiling inside - hurt, angry. How could they not tell me something like that? He was my grandfather. What the hell?!\n\nFinally, after three or four days, my dad called me over and said grandpa had passed away, that he needed to go to the funeral, and asked if I wanted to come. I didn’t even cry. Maybe that shocked him. I just looked at him calmly and said, “Yeah. I know. I’ll go.” A few days later we left. The drive took eight hours. Honestly, I didn’t even think they would take me to the actual ceremony - I thought I’d only be at the gathering afterward. I don’t remember much before the funeral. The next day we went to the cemetery. It was sunny and warm. Disgustingly warm. I felt sick inside, and everything scared me. We met relatives, talked. And then… there was this girl. A girl I’d never seen before. Neither I nor my mom knew her. My dad hugged her and said something quietly. I didn’t pay much attention. We had so many relatives, it could’ve just been someone I didn’t know or remember.\n\nThe ceremony itself was quiet. We walked into this small building where people said their goodbyes. I remember staring at the floor while tears just kept falling silently. Later, when they carried the coffin out, they “left” my grandma with me. And that broke something inside me. I was only 12, and I had to hold her up, keep her calm, swallow my own emotions, stop myself from crying - because if I broke down, she would too. I don’t blame anyone, it was a hard day for all of us. But there were enough adults there who could’ve supported another adult. Why the hell did it have to be me, a 12-year-old?\n\nAfter the burial, we went to the wake. We sat at long tables, but I couldn’t eat. My grandma stood up to give a toast for grandpa. I don’t remember her exact words, but one line froze me: “He became the father of two children and the grandfather of three.” Three?.. My brain short-circuited. I thought she misspoke. Because as far as I knew, there were only two grandchildren: me and my cousin (my dad’s brother’s son). My cousin and I stepped outside for air. I tried to comfort him, though I probably didn’t know how to do that at 12. We talked a little. And then - my dad, my mom, and that girl walked out. My mom apologized to her. My dad took me by the hand, brought me closer and said: “Emi, meet your sister. This is Lily.”Everything inside me collapsed. A sister?! What the hell?! We shook hands. She left. My dad went back inside. My mom followed, just throwing me a quick: “Don’t worry. Your cousin has half-sisters too.”\n\nAnd that was it. They just left me with this bombshell. I remember my knees giving out, sliding down to the ground… and my cousin didn’t even come over. That’s how I met my half-sister. My father’s daughter. It completely shattered my view of family. Nobody explained anything. To this day, all I know is her name, that she got married, had a son - and that’s it.\nI keep going back to that day in my mind. None of my close friends know about it. Maybe it’s not even that big of a deal. But I’m sure this was one of the reasons why my relationship with my parents fell apart in my teens. I stopped trusting them. Family trips became sources of stress for me - like I had to be responsible for everyone, like death could strike at any time, like every phone call might mean bad news.\nThe image of my father shattered. Did he abandon her? Cheat on my mom? Was she born before my mom? How could he not even stay in touch with his own child? And yet - he was the best father to me. How is that even possible?\n\nWhen I was little, I used to cry, afraid my dad would leave us for another family. Later I realized that fear was pointless - she was already grown up. And honestly, I can’t blame him for how he treated me. I was his beloved child. But still… everything both made sense and made no sense at the same time. Just a mess.\n\nI remember my mom telling me how my grandma didn’t accept me as her granddaughter, saying I didn’t look like my dad. Which was insane, because I’m his copy. Even more, I looked like her - his mother. Especially as a kid. I remember the conflicts between my mom and grandma too. But the part that hurts most? Even now, whenever grandma calls, she talks about my cousin or my half-sister (stuff I already know anyway), but never asks anything about me. She doesn’t care. At all. And that just breaks me.\n\nI don’t know what to do with this story. I’m scared to ask my dad, scared to bring it up again—it’s tied to the death of his father, after all. But at the same time, it hurts so much. Our relationship is better now, but every time someone in the family dies, they hide it from me. They only tell me later. And I end up feeling like I don’t even belong to this family. Like I’m on the outside. Like I don’t matter enough to be told. Once, I even tried to find Lily on social media. I don’t know why. Maybe I just wanted to feel like I had a sister out there who would want to talk to me, keep some connection. But I gave up. Why would she want that? She has her own family. And if she wanted to - she would’ve reached out herself.\n\nWhat would you do in my place?", "created_utc": 1758463776.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nmsygw/at_my_grandfathers_funeral_i_met_my_fathers/", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false}
{"id": "1nmssbp", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Everybody looks at me like i'm stupid", "selftext": "I (23f) walked into the teachers' office on campus the other day to book some equipment for my final project. While I was there, the teacher I was talking to asked me about my summer, what my favourite part was, etc. I told him I went to a really good music festival. He asked me what my favourite act was – I said there were so many I couldn't even pick. He asked me again, to which I replied that there were almost too many amazing options – and then everyone in the room started laughing? Like, really, really laughing. And not in a way where they were laughing because I said something funny; they were all laughing at me together. I don't really get what was so funny about what I said. there were about 7-8 of them in this office. Then they started talking to each other about what I'd said – I couldn't really understand what they were saying, but one guy said something about me and then they all laughed again, I heard them say my name and then I think something about me being dumb? Once they all calmed down the teacher helped me book the equipment. As I left he said, 'see you on friday - and maybe by then you'll be able to think of an answer' and then they all started laughing again. It felt like they all had some kind of inside joke about me. \n\nTo be honest, I brushed this off because it didn't feel like abnormal behaviour to me. I feel like anytime I talk to adults (and I use the word adults just to say people older than me, or in a position of seniority over me) I get laughed at or talked down to - or receive a 'righhhhhhhtttttt' after everything I say. Then I started to think about it. I thought back to a group feedback session with tutors that week, why was I the only one getting critiqued that harshly, or had all of those questions? Then I think about people at work, how come I'm the only one who gets made fun of by the head of department? I got home that evening and started balling. Like really balling. I've always brushed off this thought in my mind of 'everyones looking at me and thinking I'm weird' - 'everyone in here thinks I'm annoying', because its just sensitivity to social anxiety. I always worry I say the wrong thing when I barely say anything at all. But when I started to think about all these experiences that I experience on a daily - conversations I can quote, it really became apparent that this is a real thing that happens. Not everyone is scared of talking to adults, thats not something everything goes through. I never feel comfortable to speak to these people because I just know something negative is coming my way, and it always does. I just don't know what it is about me that invites this in ? I always know, If I enter a conversation with adults and talk, its a matter of seconds before someone makes a patronising comment and they all laugh. I thought that maybe I'm not being confident enough in myself, so I try to be confident in my own decisions and thoughts, but its almost like that makes it worse? \n\nI've never said this outloud to anyone. This is the first time I've ever verablised this feeling and its actually made me think theres more to it. I just don't know whats wrong with me. I feel like no matter what I do, its always the wrong one.

Now I am reaching 26, and for the first time since then, a considerable amount of people do not know I am gay. Historically, I have made my sexuality apparent within maybe a week of getting to know people. I date a lot so I often have a story to tell about it, I am not exactly masculine in almost any way, and most relevantly, most of my life and the stuff I engage in is queer as hell.\n\nHowever, I moved very far away from where I lived all my life. I wanted a fresh start, and while this wasn’t my main step in doing so, I’ve chosen not to tell people I am gay. My coworkers know I date a lot, they take interest in my dating life, but I do not specify gender. I don’t correct them when they ask if I “have a girl.” It’s mostly lying by omission — which I know in this case could just be viewed as keeping that part of my life private. Could be viewed like that, but I know it’s mostly out of being afraid I’ll be treated differently. Even something as minor as no longer being asked about my dating life, but worse, my job is one of the most gossipy environments I’ve ever witnessed. It’s also incredibly tough; most of my coworkers are ex military. They’re all a bunch of heterosexual men but they chat like Disney channel teenage girls. I don’t like the idea of even the slightest comment of my sexual orientation being something they’d needle at. They would not treat me poorly but many I know would be a little offput by this. I’ve dropped little hints that probably people my age would get are signs that I am not straight, but most people at work are much older than I. They’re great people, I don’t want to trouble the waters.\n\nWhat set me over the edge, what’s got me so frustrated is that Friday, I stopped myself from ACTIVELY lying. I almost claimed I was going on a date with a woman. I was not. I am a part of a big social sports league, and I pretended like I didn’t remember the name of the league when asked (also on Friday) because it’s actually incredibly queer. I know that being more private about this, especially considering my environment, is rational. However, the younger form of me was so much braver. He believed that it was my responsibility to be open, to represent however minorly that we are everywhere. Now, I get anxious even wearing something gay at the grocery store.

The idea was to look out for each other financially, as neither of us can afford the flat on our own. Although in hindsight I can see how this is unrealistic and unfair. \n\nHere’s the issue - I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year, and a couple of months ago we decided we’d like to move in together. This wouldn’t even be happening until August 2026, as I’d just renewed our lease. I told my flatmate within days of making the decision, so she has 14 months’ notice.\n\nHer reaction was extreme. She immediately called me selfish, a bad friend, and said I’d be making her “homeless.” She’s also said that if I leave, she’ll have to move back to her dad’s (several hours away), which would mean quitting her job. I do feel bad, but I honestly thought I was being considerate by giving her over a year to prepare and by offering to help find solutions. Instead, she’s refused to even have a proper conversation about it, and when we do talk about it, I’m made to feel guilty and it feels like she doesn’t want to listen to my side of the story. \n\nThe way I see it, I can’t put my relationship on hold forever because of a verbal pact we made three years ago. I want to support my friend, but it feels unreasonable for her to expect me to delay a huge step in my life indefinitely, especially when I’ve given her so much notice and offered to help.\n\nSo, AITA for planning to move in with my boyfriend even though it breaks the agreement I made with my flatmate?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n1) The agreement was verbal, not legally binding.\n2) The lease runs until July 2026, with both of our names on it.\n3) Rent is split 50/50; neither of us could afford the flat solo, but she makes a bit more money than me and has the ability to do overtime a lot more than I can. \n4) I’ve offered to help her find someone new or look for alternatives, but she’s flatly refused.\n", "created_utc": 1758470055.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nmvlaq/aita_for_moving_in_with_my_boyfriend/", "score": 4, "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false}

There are 4 of us: 22 (M), 22 (F) and 23 (NB) and me who play + the DM (56M). A few years ago, the group bullied one of our players (22M) until he ghosted us. The dynamic of the group: we all have ADHD (the poor DM - ahahahaha!) and 22M has a sprinkle of Autism and depression. \n\nNow? That group is bullying me. What does that mean? Eye rolling at my decisions, grunting when I make a move, \"mansplaining\" my moves, talking over me when I am playing my part, and similar things. It's not all the time, but probably 25% of the time. Same thing that happened to the previous player.\n\nLast year, I talked to the DM and explained my concern. I also mentioned that the group bullied the former player until he decided to ghost us. He was empathetic and said that we would fix it as a group. I told him that my expectation was that I be part of the conversation. \n\nThe next time we met? I said I had to be done by 9:00 (work the next day). 9:00 rolled around. No conversation. I looked at him and said I could stay until 10:00. Still no conversation. I said I had to go and packed up my stuff. RIGHT AFTER I LEFT - they had the conversation. Two of the players said that I was over-reacting and that they were just playing and having fun. The DM agreed - kind of throwing me under the bus (when he and I talked, there was no mention of how he felt about my participation). I was hearing this in the moment from the 22F who (according to her) was dumbfounded about their reaction and leaving me out of the conversation.\n\nI waited a day and sent a text that said (I am paraphrasing) \"I don't appreciate the group having a conversation about how I feel without me being there.\" The DM and 22F are my \"framily,\" so there is hesitation on my part to be more assertive.\n\nSince then, one member has dropped out (and is still chatting with the DM) - the 22M with adhd/autism/depression. He is saying he needs to take care of himself, which is completely fair - but he hasn't mentioned if it was because of the group and the group dynamics.\n\nA few months later, we got together and the DM and us had a conversation about how to respect one another while playing.

They said the person's name and I recognized it as my brother and didn't answer. He immediately called again and I felt compelled to answer. He was in jail and needed 2k to bond out. I said no and hung up. I make a lot of money so it wasn't the amount, it was the fact that we don't have a close relationship. Yes, we both have the same father (and I have two other older brothers from my father) but I didn't even know of my brother's names until I was a teenager. He randomly told me I had brothers when I was a child to begin with. \n\nMy brother didn't call back and neither did my dad so I thought the situation was done. Last weekend, my father invited me to lunch so I went. Why not? My daughter was with me and it'd been a while since they saw each other. I wasn't even there for 15 minutes before he started scolding me about not bonding my brother out. I told him what I'm saying now; I don't know his son that much. I saw him in person when I played football in high school and he was playing for the opposite team. But we didn't even speak there.

He's still your brother and you should've helped him out.\"\n\nSo now I'm second guessing myself like damn.. should I have bailed him out? I had the money. Still, my dad lives and is with the mother of his other sons. He was even with her when my mom was pregnant and he's consistent in their life so bailing his son out was his responsibility in my opinion. His other 2 sons, I haven't even met.

They were finished around the same time, and we both worked and saved really hard to make it happen. She has more money to spend than I do, while I put literally every cent I had into my place. I even painted my own walls and stairs because I couldn’t afford to hire anyone.\n\nOur relationship is generally good: we do a lot together, but sometimes it feels shallow, like she doesn’t really see or hear me. A few years ago, I came out to her. I told her, very vulnerably, that as a man I’m into men. Instead of support or empathy, she got angry and disapproving. Since then, she’s completely ignored it, as if that conversation never even happened, as I did as well eventually. I come from a culture where being gay is not accepted, and my parents still don’t know, so her reaction really hurt.\nThat being said, we’ve also helped each other out a lot. She’s given me rides, I painted her stairs and hung her lamps, and I even encouraged her to buy her house, which turned out to be a great investment.\n\nThe vacation:\nMy sister has been bringing up going on a trip together for a while, and I finally agreed. I arranged vacation days at work, and the plan was Rome, with our mom joining us. I was excited to show them the city since I’ve been there before.\nBut then our mom dropped out (for unrelated reasons, but it would be too long to write), leaving just me and my sister. Around the same time, I had to do my garden because weeds and sand kept blowing into my house. That wiped out my budget (but I knew from the vocation before).\n\nTechnically, I could still go if I put it on my credit card and paid it off with my next paycheck. But honestly, I’m exhausted from all the house stuff (really busy each weekend since April, besides 5 days full time work), and the thought of going on vacation with such a tight budget stresses me out instead of relaxing me and I also vocations themselves in general are exhausting instead of relaxing at home.\nI tried explaining this to my sister, but she immediately got disappointed (at least I assumed). I have a really hard time saying no to people and hate letting anyone down. Last night, I finally told her everything: that I do want to go, but I feel pressured and stressed about money right now.\nShe got went quiet, left earlier than planned, and now I feel guilty all over again.\n\nAITA for canceling the vacation after I already agreed?\n\nEdit: nothing is booked or planned yet and she could still change the days she took off at work. So nothing needs to be cancelled. Also were have already booked a spa together in a few weeks to relax in our home country. BTW to give some perspective about the gay part: you may speak of cognitive dissonance within her. She also loves me and it's the other way around. It is a complex topic within a complex culture, just cutting off all contact isn't the right response for me and I wouldn't want that. We really need to have a conversation about that again, but I feel like she isn't open for it and I'm honestly afraid to bring it up again.

My mom was with us but she wasn't as deep in the crowd as we were because she isn't so crazy about pits anymore, and she told us to make sure we all stick together. Susan was trying to get more to the left in the crowd since we were at the side, but me and Ellie agreed that we were in a pretty good spot. I told Susan that when people start jumping it'll be easier to move up closer (since the crowd will probably start to shift around, I didn't mean we'll start pushing through or something) There was this one couple beside me,both adults and drinking, with the man being a whole head taller than I was. During one of the openers, my friend Susan started whispering something about moving up and I just let her in front of me. She said something to the couple (idk what) and they let her past them so I held on to her, grabbed Ellie even though she said she didn't want to move, and tried to follow so we don't get lost when the woman got really close to my face and started yelling that I can't go through and that she heard me talking about moving up (when I told my friend it'll be easier when people are jumping). I tried to answer that I'm just trying to follow my friend so we don't get lost but she yelled some more and didn't let me through.

I kept holding my friend in front of the woman since I don't want her to get lost in her first concert, and I wasnt sure if she will keep asking people to move up and I also didn't want Susan to end up in a mosh pit or something because I heard those could get dangerous. The woman took our hands and put them behind her between her and her bf. We kept holding hands until the bf complained that they were near his crotch (which we haven't noticed) so we just lifted them up a bit but still held on and he started yelling about etiquette or something while I tried to tell him Im just trying not to lose my friend but I think Susan got scared because she just let go and the man just turned his back to me. This left Susan a bit further than me and Ellie and I couldn't enjoy that opener because I was stressing the whole time she would move up further or something. I finally got her attention after the opener ended and some people just let me and Ellie past so that we were closer to her (I think they saw how much I was trying to get her attention and telling her to just move back) but that was so stressful and ruined the concert for me.

About a week ago I was invited through snapchat group chat with me, my friend and 3 other close friends (one of which is my roommate). 1 of the ppl invited couldn’t come as they were visiting family.\n(EDIT: I informed him when the plans were originally brought up that I would be late as I work in a bar and was scheduled 3-fin and did not know when I’d finish)\n\nOn the day of, I reminded him I’d be late but would be there. My roommate was ill so she texted him to let him know she wouldnt be there. I was under the impression that left me and my 2 friends hanging out and smoking together. \n\nOnce I finished work I texted the gc to let them know I was omw. Once I got to my friends house I was told my other friend left early. I felt bad and let him know I was there, only to see him walking down the street with 5 people- 1 being my friends gf and another being a guy I used to hookup with, with his gf in tow. \n\nMe and this guy ended semi-well and I am happily dating someone else, however seeing him after 5 months was a shock and unexpected. I was informed I had missed the smoke sesh and instead we were going for a drink at my friends favourite pub. Although I didnt particularly want to go (as I don’t drink regularly and also had not eaten all day) I figured I’d stay for drink, have a catchup and catch my bus home.\n\nOnce we got to the pub we were greeted by 10+ other ppl (most of which I didn’t know, however 1 was a good friend of mine. Another was a guy I had gone on a date with, however we weren’t compatible and didnt see each other again). This was another shock. Having come from work my social battery wasnt prepared to meet so many new people as well as hang out with 2 guys I had history with. I expressed this to my close friend and said Id only stay for 1. \n\nAs I went to say goodbye to my friend it took so long to say goodbye I missed my bus and my phone promptly died. I went back to the pub, put my phone on charge behind the bar and stayed (uncomfortably) for 1 more. I spent my entire night with my close friend as I hadnt seen him in months and the birthday boy was busy chatting to old friends.\n\nI felt like Id been tricked into agreeing to a plan I didn’t want to do. I had only gone bc I thought it was a small get together with my close friends- something I could leave and catch my bus from easily.\n\nInstead I spent my evening uncomfortably hanging out with a giant group of strangers and 2 guys I quite honestly didnt want to see.\n\nIm upset with my friend for not telling me the whole plan and who would be there as I wouldn’t have gone had I known it was a large night out. I texted him once I got home saying it was nice to see him but to warn me next time if those guys would be there and he told me he didn’t think ‘it’s that deep’. \n\nI dont know if I have a right to be upset as those guys are his friends but I wish Id been told what the real plans were so I could make an informed decision of whether I wanted to go. Part of me thinks he didnt tell me bc Id be more likely to show up if he didnt mention it.\nAITA?\n\nEDIT:\nIve realised I should’ve mentioned this was 1 of 2 birthday celebrations I was invited to, to celebrate his birthday. One being ‘a chill smoke session’ with the people in the group chat and the second being a larger night out. I was working when the night out was planned so I couldn’t go to that. However, many of friends that were at the pub (including both exes) had plans to stay over at my friends place. Meaning even if we didnt go out drinking (which isnt rlly the problem here) both ppl wouldve been there.", "created_utc": 1758437427.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nml0ae/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_over_his_birthday/", "score": 3, "num_comments": 34, "over_18": false}

I felt bad because I trusted her words.\n     The next argument we had was over food. I need to eat three times a day. She exists off of coffee and one small, to me at least, meal at night. She would not stop and let me buy myself food instead insisting I eat the items she brought.  I do not particularly like those items. Anytime I bring up a restaurant, she said she felt pressured to eat and that it would make her sick. I never ment to pressure her into eating.

This arrangement started shortly after the COVID  because my friend group lacked responsible roommate candidates. They were constantly job-hopping and bickering over petty things. Initially, it was a good situation because my mom treats me like an adult, respects my boundaries, and acted as a roommate in every sense.\n\nHowever, this year, my brother fell on hard times and had to move in with us, along with his girlfriend and several young children.

Two days before Mother’s Day, my aunt Alisha  came over to invite us to a party on the same day as Mother’s Day and before she left, she asked how my aunt Beth felt about being a grandma.

All my mom said was, “Yes, she’s happy to be a grandma,” and then my aunt left and that was truly it. \n\nOn Mother’s Day, Jen and Beth dropped off some chicken at our house for my mom to cook. My mom told them that Aunt Alisha knew about the baby and had seen them at the store. Jen started crying, told my mom to shut up and not talk about it because it was going to ruin her day, and asked why Aunt Alisha had to know. They ended up leaving and didn’t come back for the gathering.\n\nThe next day, Aunt Beth sent my mom a message basically saying that people were talking badly about Jen and the baby, that they were extremely hurt, and that we had ruined Jen’s first Mother’s Day. She also said the whole situation could have been avoided. My mom didn’t reply because we honestly don’t think we did anything wrong we felt like they were being dramatic.\n\nNow it’s September, and they still haven’t reached out to us like they normally would.

For context I have always pictured my Papa (mom’s dad) walking me down the aisle. He was the main male role model in my life. My parents split when I was 4 and my dad came to visit twice a year, my Papa lived just down the street and my mom worked long hours so I spent more time with my Nana and Papa than I did with my dad. He made my lunches for school, he taught me to fish, he gave me money to go out with my friends, the whole 9 yards. \n\nHere’s my dilemma, my Dad and I have rekindled in the last couple years. We went 6 years without speaking due to my resentment of him visiting so little. I blocked him when I was 16 and at 22 I reached out and apologized to him for shutting him out for so long (I was an angry teenager, then in my early 20’s it was a matter of pride) Since we’ve rekindled we talk on the phone occasionally and go out for dinners and catch up, he has met my fiancé once as well. \n\nDuring one of our phone calls recently he asked me if I had been dress shopping yet, I told him no I hadn’t, and he said to let him know when I’d be going as he’d like to pay for my dress. I told him no and it was too large of a gift and he insisted, saying “I’m your dad, it’s my job to buy your wedding dress.” This really made me emotional for some reason I can’t quite put my finger on yet and then it turned to extreme guilt. \n\nI feel that because he is paying for the dress and because of what he said it would be cruel to accept such a large gift and then not give him the opportunity to walk his only daughter down the aisle, but in my heart I know I still want my Papa to be the one to give me away, he’s the one I spent Father’s Day with every year, and he’s he one I did the father daughter dance with at family weddings. \n\nI still can’t shake the guilt and I feel it might be my subconscious knowing it would be wrong to treat my Dad this way.

The project came from F1’s idea and F1 led the group in planning and overall system architecture. It was a hard, seven-month project, and we all had to contribute a significant effort.\n\nIn the first half of the project (3.5 months), I did what I could, but there were times I wasn't sure what my tasks were because F1 didn't delegate well. I would ask for additional tasks but would then be told \"I don't know what work to delegate to you\". If I had downtime, I felt okay providing assistance to F3 with their things. Meanwhile, F2 contributed nothing. He showed up to meetings but never seemed to work on anything. He'd say that he was \"working on it,\" but nothing seemed to actually come of it. He didn't volunteer to take on small helpful things like documenting notes or coordinating meetings.\n\nThe Encounter\n\nAbout halfway through, us four had a private conversation and agreed to keep things strictly between us iv. I told F2 directly (but in a calm tone) that it was no fair that he had not contributed. His excuse? \"I didn't know how to do anything.\" The only complaint they had of me was that I was not as productive in the first half, although even F1 would admit that it was because they were not clear about delegating the work. Yet, F1 came to F2's rescue by stating that he was a \"fun person\" and we must \"cut him some slack\" because F2 was \"trying to improve\". F1 even invited us to hang out, which kind of felt like they were excusing everybody from the situation altogether. \n\nSecond half of project\n\nI actually stepped up and did more than was required of me. In the end, we all were able to finish with good grades. But... that was not the end of it...\n\nThe aftermath\n\nThat summer, I learned, via F1, that F2 was saying around town that I was lying about him, specifically that I called him \"useless\" to other people. This was not true. The only people I ever discussed F2's lack of work with were F1 and F3. I went back to several people I might have said anything to, and they confirmed that I never said anything about F2. In spite of all of this, F2 ghosted me, and he blocked me.

My weekends are usually very busy with rigid schedules - my parents know this. My son had football this morning from 10:20-11:00 and my mum said that she would let me know when I should start making my way to collect them from Heathrow airport to minimise pick-up charges. \n\nIt was a tight schedule this morning as I also had to walk the dogs before football, take kid to football and restock the house with essential groceries plus some extra for a nice dinner that I had planned for my parents upon their return and unpack my very small car to make space for their luggage. \n\nSo my mum calls me at 12:00 to say they’ve just landed and then 25 mins later lets me know they’re ready to be collected. I had just finished the food shop and I just had to unpack it then I was going to collect them. This would mean my parents would have to wait 35 mins for me to collect them. I let them know as much. \n\nMy parents turned around and yelled saying don’t bother and how they didn’t care about the food shopping, and that I was unkind and unhelpful (I drove them an hour to Gatwick for their departure flight). They just expected me to be there right away. So I responded by letting them know I was on my way as soon as I had put all the refrigerated items away. They let me know this wasn’t good enough. So I told them, I drove you to Gatwick, did a few chores for them whilst they were away that were a big expense time and money-wise that they’ve yet to pay me back for and that they can get a taxi home. I then hung up as I found their attitude to be completely disrespectful. \n\nThey called me back right away doubling-down that I’m an AH so I repeated “get a taxi”.

They have stonewalled me since. \n\nIn comparison, they refused to drive 10 mins to the train station to pick me up when I came back from Italy with an ear infection so had to get a taxi home. Whilst the distance home is considerably shorter, they refused because they didn’t feel like it not because they couldn’t. \n\nI may have been the AH by telling them to get a taxi and hanging up but I feel that I need to get an outside perspective as I feel justified in my decision based on principle of respect. \n\nUPDATE:\nSo my parents did get a taxi home in the end and I didn’t greet them because I was still angry with them.

The family rule has always been that if I am in school and trying, I do not pay rent, just cover my own gas, clothes, and fun expenses.\nI worked two jobs this summer. I quit the first because they wanted me to skip classes to work. After a month of job hunting, I got a flexible job that pays above minimum wage, but my stepdad insists I get a second job because he worked two jobs in school. We are studying very different things, as he dropped out of an electrician program while I am pre-law and working on a business degree. I do not have a car payment, debt, or major expenses, and my family is financially stable, so there is no practical reason for me to work two jobs besides teaching me responsibility.\nThis has spilled over into other things. For my 18th birthday, all I wanted was room décor instead of dorm items since I could not go to a dorm. My mom told me to buy it myself because I am an adult and only got me new sheets after I reminded her it was supposed to be a gift. I was very grateful as I had been asking for years for new sheets. I am in physical therapy for scoliosis. They initially agreed to cover my copays, but I have received no reimbursement, and my stepdad claims my diagnoses such as scoliosis, bee allergy, and autism are fake.\nHe also thinks I should start paying for things my grandma has always covered, like hair appointments and shoes. My grandma said absolutely not when I told her he wanted me to cover it. When I asked my grandma for shoes before I started my job, since mine were falling apart, I was called an irresponsible brat.\nThe biggest argument is food. I am a picky eater, partly due to texture issues and an eating disorder. My parents know this, but one night when I did not eat dinner because I was not hungry, they told me they were done buying special food for me and I should start paying for my own groceries since I have a job. This felt harsh since it would not hurt them financially and I am saving for university which costs sixteen thousand a year.\nI also do believe that they would eat the food that I buy, as anytime I get myself food it always seems to go missing.\nWhen I brought it up with my mom, she doubled down and said I am too picky and it is not unreasonable. I cannot tell if I am being selfish or if this is genuinely unfair.

It started two years ago after she never offered me ANY condolences after my father passed away.  My parents actually lived two doors down from my in laws, a transition that took place several years ago when both sides relocated due to getting older and wanting to be close by my husband and me.  I am not exaggerating when I say she offered zero words of sympathy, despite being friends with my parents and spending much time with them.  He died on her birthday, which meant we obviously didn’t celebrate her day as intended, then two days later she insisted we go to her house for cake, and even then she said nothing to me and offered no condolences, no hug, not even a “how are you doing?” So admittedly I do have a bone of contention with her. \n\nFast forward to this June and my FIL passed away after a gradual progression of dementia. Since then she has been texting my husband every morning to let him know she is “OK” - he says he told her to do this. Times have ranged from 0430, 0530, 0630…every day of the week.  The texts wake me up and most of the time I can’t go back to sleep, especially if it is 0500 or later.  The kicker is my husband doesn’t wake up, just me…he just keeps snoring away un-phased.  I have asked him to consider texting her when HE wakes up instead, since he doesn’t even seem to know when she texts him.  I have asked him to turn his phone on do not disturb, or even  reduced distractions, but he can’t because of his job he has to be available if needed (though rarely) in the middle of the night (he has a hospice job).  If he isn’t waking up when she texts him, I don’t get the point of her texting him at these hours.  During the week I can tolerate it, as I am up by 0615, but on the weekends I would enjoy sleeping in a bit…even if just until 0700, but the MIL alarm keeps on ringing.  I have even tried ear plugs, but I really hate sleeping with ear plugs, one always falls out - and honestly, why should I be forced to sleep like this when a simple solution would be for him to just call or text her when he wakes instead?

We have 2 daughters and we are having a third. We just recently found out the gender of our third which is a boy. My husband and I are overly excited but a few of his family members didn't have the reaction he was hoping for, his mother in particular. When he told me of her reaction it really hurt me because he was hurt and he has been waiting for a boy and this is going to be our last child. I already have a strained relationship my MIL. She recently wanted to talk to my children and while talking to my children she was acting overly excited to them about the news but was also asking my oldest if we had told her making it seem like if we hadn't she was going to be the one to tell them. I am already emotional during this pregnancy and when I heard her do that I felt very territorial over my family, I took the phone from my child because 1) I wasn't going to let her think that if we didn't tell our children that she was going to get that opportunity; and 2) Her reaction towards our children was a lot more happier than it was to her own son. I told her that she hurt her son feelings by the poor reaction she gave him because he was hoping for some exciting like she gave us when we told her we were having girls. She immediately got defensive which she started saying things to make her seem like mother of the year like we have treated her poorly. I was not going to fight with her because my mental health is more important during this pregnancy especially keeping the stress levels down. My only goal in that moment was to tell her she hurt her sons feelings and that she should apologize like a normal parent would do when they hurt their child's feelings. I did tell my husband of what happened feeling bad in the moment that I caused an issue and put him in the middle of it because he is the type of person who doesn't like to share his feelings with anyone but me. She reached out to him and told him her \"version\" of the conversation.

{"id": "1nmv56g", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "title": "If you want good habits to stick, simply reduce the friction", "selftext": "**Who is this for?** People that want a simple and easy way for good habits to stick and bad ones to unstick\n\n**Better life philosophy #9**\n\nOne of the things that has been key to me sticking to my good habits—and was doing for a long time without realising—was reducing the friction between me and the good habits that I wanted to stick.\n\nIt's part of human nature that—whilst it may not be in our best interest—we tend to lean towards the easiest option when making a decision. This is why we may choose to sit on the sofa watching TV over going for a run, or why we carry on playing videogames rather than meditating. We want to receive pleasure using the least amount of energy possible. In other words, we want the option that's most within our reach. \n\nThink about it like this: Would you rather sit on the bench right next to you, or the slightly nicer one 100m away? Whilst the bench beside you isn't necessarily better than the one further away, it's the distance between you and the two benches that influences your decision on which one to sit on and therefore, you end up going with the most in reach option.\n\nThis idea is backed up by James Clear in Atomic Habits when talking about how companies fight to get their products within eye level on the shelves in supermarkets. Shoppers tend to lean towards buying products within their eyesight as opposed to ones on the top or bottom shelf (regardless of how good either product is), which not only requires more effort to reach, but requires more effort to be within their eyesight in the first place.\n\nWhen I couldn't stick to working out, having to get changed, travel to the gym, wait for people to finish with the weights, travelling back home, etc all increased the friction between me and working out which ultimately lead me to be wildly inconsistent. I kept telling myself 'If it didn't feel like such a chore (because of all the things I had to do beforehand), I would stay consistent'. And so I decided to put that to the test and make it easier to workout by decreasing the friction between myself and it. \n\nI did this by buying equipment for my flat (which eliminated the factors causing friction mentioned above). I even took it a step further by investing in adjustable dumbbells to reduce the friction even more of having to continually switch the plates. Reducing the friction between me and this habit I wanted to adopt has been key to me being consistent with all my other good habits as the principle remains the same regardless of the specific habit you are trying to adopt into your paradigm. \n\nIn the same way that reducing friction between you and your good habits helps them to stick, increasing the friction helps with getting bad habits to unstick. \n\nIncreasing the distance between me and my bad habits made it a lot easier not to indulge in them. One of my best applications of this came from my desire to stop binge eating snacks. I achieved this by simply refraining from buying these kinds of foods in my weekly shop. This simple act of not buying snacks increased the friction tremendously as I put physical distance between me and this bad habit meaning that if I wanted snacks, I would have to get changed and go all the way down to the shop to get them. \n\nAs mentioned previously about humans picking the easiest option, it was easier to just not go out to get snacks as opposed to getting changed and going down to the store—It simply wasn't worth the effort for the 'reward'. \n\nSo, how do you begin to get the good habits to stick and bad ones unstick? Given the above, you need to be able to answer the following questions: 'What habit do I want to stick/unstick?' and 'How can I reduce/increase the friction between me and this particular habit?'.\n\nA simple exercise that helped me when answering these questions was to simply make a list of all the good habits that I wanted to stick. Once you have your full list of habits you want to stick, reflect upon each one and note down next to it how you can reduce the friction for that particular habit.\n\nYou can then apply this same method for the bad habits you want to unstick by making a list of all your bad habits, and then reflecting upon and noting down how you can increase the friction for each one. \n\nIf you're stuck for ways to decrease the friction, here is a simple 2 step method to decrease the friction between you and a good habit:\n\n1. Reduce the physical distance between you and that particular habit\n2. Once it's within your grasp, reduce the amount of effort it takes to indulge in that particular habit\n(see my example above with working out how I first reduced the distance by bringing the gym to me and then honing down on reducing the effort by getting adjustable dumbbells). \n\nThen for getting bad habits to unstick, simply do the opposite of the above practice: Increase the distance then increase the effort. \n\nThe good and bad thing about habits is the more you do them, the more they become a part of your paradigm, and thus automatic. When using this in the context of fixing your habits, this is beneficial since after a while you won't have to apply so much conscious effort into maintaining each and every good habit, nor will you have to keep applying  copious amounts of conscious effort in resisting the bad ones. \n\nIf you've found that you've decreased the friction as much as possible but still can't get yourself to do that particular habit, tell yourself that you'll do it for 5 minutes and then stop after that. Sure enough when I've done this myself, such as telling myself I'll do one set before stopping my workout, I find that I end up doing the thing for a lot longer than I had initially planned or end up seeing it all the way through. The simple act of getting the ball rolling makes it harder to stop as you've began to build speed and momentum for that activity. \n\nThink of it like pushing a boulder down a hill. Initially the boulder is hard to push but once you get it to roll down that hill, you need even more effort to get it to stop rolling down the hill. And more importantly, you no longer need to exert any more energy into getting it to roll.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that humans will always lean towards whichever option is easiest and requires the least amount of effort. So always look to make the good habits easy and the bad ones hard. \n\nTldr;\n\nGet good habits to stick &gt; decrease friction\n\nGet bad habits to unstick &gt; increase friction", "created_utc": 1758469009.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nmv56g/if_you_want_good_habits_to_stick_simply_reduce/", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nmgtsx", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "title": "School, sobriety, STRIDE, and turning 40. . . somehow, it’s all working.", "selftext": "So, it’s been a whirlwind, which feels cliché, but honestly, nothing else fits. I’m two and a half weeks into my bachelor’s program, and I had no idea what I was walking into.\n\nI went into this with a long résumé of jobs and careers. This time, I wasn’t going to be working. I was going to be a full-time student, supported by a benefits program with a basic stipend that kept our family afloat. I kept telling people, \"It won’t be any harder than a full-time job.\" I wasn’t wrong, but I wasn’t right, either.\n\nIf we’re talking about workload, sure, this first semester doesn’t touch the pressure of some jobs I’ve had. But that’s misleading. These are intro classes. The volume is manageable, but the structure is... wild. Each class is like its own freelance gig with a different boss, platform, system, and expectation. Nothing prepares you for how non-intuitive it all feels at first. I spent the first two weeks in a daze. That unfamiliarity hit hard.\n\nBut now? I think I’m settling in.\n\nSTRIDE (my structured system for tracking creative and personal growth) helped, though not without its own chaos. I prepped four academic-specific trackers, confident I was ready. Spoiler: I wasn’t. My main academic sheet was rebuilt from scratch, not once, but multiple times. But it's better now. My dashboard actually feels like it works for me. And STRIDE hasn’t just held, it’s evolved with me.\n\nOutside of classes, I’ve added new emotional tracking. I’m engaging in therapy. I’ve started discussions again. And just yesterday, I kicked off STRIDE lessons for the first time in months, drafted over 2,000 words in a single session, integrating both my academic and personal reading. It was surreal. It felt like everything I’ve built was finally clicking.\n\nAnd that’s not the only thing happening.\n\nI turn 40 at the end of the month. I just passed my 1-year smoke-free milestone. And in a few days, I’ll hit one full year sober. That one still doesn’t feel real. We weren’t drinking much anymore, life with little kids doesn’t really allow it, but when we did, I went overboard. Way too often. Like I was 22 and trying to forget something. This year has been different. I don’t miss it. I don’t miss the fog or the fake joy or the hangovers.\n\nHonestly, what I crave now is presence. I want to enjoy my family. I want to keep building. I want to stay reliable, because I never really was before. And the craziest part? That feels normal now.\n\nNext week, I’m starting a new episode of general mental health care. I want to work on my defensiveness. I want to be less reactive. I want my family to get the version of me that’s not on edge all the time. And I want that for myself, too.\n\nSo that’s where I’m at. STRIDE. School. Family. Sobriety. Therapy. Growth.\n\nIt’s all happening at once, and somehow, it’s working. Not to make it small because in my life it's not, but my youngest turns 4 in a week too. That's the biggest part of my life even with all of this other stuff. Just think, she turns 4 and 2 days later I turn 40. I'll officially be 10 times her age. Its wild.\n\nSo if you’re on your own STRIDE journey, or just figuring out how to hold multiple parts of yourself together, I’d love to hear about it. Ask me anything. Share what you’re building. Let’s talk.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nJust started my bachelor's program at 39, fully immersed in school, STRIDE (my structured system for tracking creative and personal growth), therapy, and family life. It's chaotic, intense, and somehow, working. Hit 1 year smoke-free, almost 1 year sober, and rebuilding everything from the ground up. STRIDE is evolving with me, and for the first time, so am I.", "created_utc": 1758422974.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nmgtsx/school_sobriety_stride_and_turning_40_somehow_its/", "score": 15, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nm3aum", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "title": "18 years old, no education. UK based.", "selftext": "Without delving too deep, I struggled immensely during my childhood and teenage years. I had serious mental health issues due to 10+ years of trauma revolving around domestic violence. Covid took over some of the most important highschool years in terms or education and socialisation as I wasn’t very socialised growing up. It made me insanely scared to go outside, it definitely didn’t help that I was already very socially inept and anxious during every situation. Because of this I didn’t go to high school and have no GCSE’s, no formal education at all. And I know GCSE’s don’t shape the rest of your future but being so young they’re still very important and relevant in my life, to be able to get a job, to be able to receive more education. I’ve decided that the mess I’m in now, isn’t what I want, I don’t want to be classed as a neet for years to come, I don’t want to be trapped on benefits growing up (no hate to anybody who is, unfortunately the system can make it very difficult to get out of them when you start on them, and they also saved my childhood from homelessness at the very least.) But it is a cycle I really dont want to get into so early because it will dig me into a hole difficult to get out of. For the past year I’ve been trying my best to get out, I’ve been to numerous job interviews but have been rejected by all, I’ve applied for volunteering but have been told to email back and when I’ve emailed back their positions have still been full. I have managed to get myself a gig babysitting around my family, which is how I paid for driving lessons and my driving test is in 9 days. (Hope I pass) I live in the middle of nowhere with one bus, so by driving I hope more opportunities open up for jobs and socialising.\n\nI’ll get to my actual question here. I really would like to get my GCSE’s and a better education, I have found a college somewhat nearby that have recently opened up a level 1 course in BTEC Animal care (though I found about it late unfortunately.) It also means I can get my GCSE’s alongside the course whilst not having to pay for them privately. Is it too late for me to join a level 1 college course? Everyone will be 2-3 years younger than me and probably have more experience than me. Is it worth it to ring the college and explain my situation and ask if I’m able to be a late applicant if there are spaces available? Or do you think I should keep trying for full time work? Honestly I feel very lost, my family aren’t very supportive and expect me to fail at everything but I’m tired of failing and I want to build a better future for myself and stop looking back at a past I’m never going to be able to change or make better. If I can’t apply this year, is it better I keep trying for full time work and pay to get my maths and English GCSE’s and apply next year when I’m 19 instead? Any advice would be fantastic thank you, even if I don’t reply to it straight away I promise I am reading it.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758387195.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nm3aum/18_years_old_no_education_uk_based/", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false}

I woke up very late, got punished for being late, and on top of that I forgot both my work keys and my home keys. The whole day already started in chaos before it even really began. Work was one of the most stressful days ever — problems just kept piling up while I was trying to handle everything. Everyone around me was acting completely normal, like it was just another Saturday. I kept thinking even a small “happy birthday,” a little smile, or just a short chat would have been nice.\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. A group of smallkids ( scouts )came to our workplace with thier leader  curious to learn about what we do. I got the chance to explain everything to them, almost like I was their teacher or guide. They listened closely, asked questions, and even clapped for me after I finished.they even thank us for working hard to our country .That moment honestly made my day — I felt seen, respected, and appreciated in a way I didn’t expect.\n\nAnd to top it all off, today’s food was the best. Saturdays come with BBQ, sauces, and even ice cream, and it felt like a little celebration just for me. Between the scouts’ applause and the amazing food, my birthday turned out better than I thought it would.

Yesterday I (16m) tried to apologize to an ex friend for my racist behavior last year. I wrote her a letter, asking her to meet me in a particular spot after class. Not only did she not show up, she wrote me a very long letter back, telling me that she is not interested in hearing my apology and listing a series of grievances against me. She said that she doesn’t think I’ve changed at all. She told me to use this as an opportunity to reflect on my privilege and realize that the world does not revolve around me. \nShe is completely right, by the way. I was/am a racist narcissistic person. Last year I ruined our friendship with ‘jokes’ and ‘debates’ that were soaked in racism. She has no obligation to hear me. She has every reason to not think I will give a sincere apology. The apologies I gave her last year were gross and manipulative. I was gross and manipulative.\nTo top it off, a few days ago I, without thinking, said something insensitive to one of my friends during a class discussion (not culturally insensitive but insensitive nevertheless). That friend forgave me but it must have planted more doubt in her mind.\nShe told me to never communicate with her again. She is completely right to request that.  But I’m so sad that I couldn’t tell her all of that. \nI think my only course of action is to unlearn my awful behavior, to learn how to not want to push boundaries and insert my own self image into everything. I’m not sure how to do that. I need help. I read white fragility last year but I’m not sure how much of a dent. Do you have any recommendations? Literature? Exercises? Literally anything else? I’m lost and I don’t see any way out. All I want to do now is make sure that I don’t die a horrible person and avoid something like this in the future.

{"id": "1nlv688", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "title": "Making incremental steps rather than the revolution", "selftext": "I have a drinking issue. Am I the cliché of the alcoholic guy whose hands are shaking because he doesn't have his morning whisky? No. But I've learnt that this stereotype only represents a fraction of alcoholic people. For example, there are alcoholic people who only drink \"socially\" but it turns out that they go out three times a week, getting blasted every single time; there are alcoholics who just drink one single glass per day, not getting drunk, but if they can't have their \"little treat\" after work, they become crazy; there are alcoholics who, because they're bored in life, drink beers during the evening, a few times per week, to get at least a buzz and sometimes, they get fucking drunk. I'm this last type.\n\nI've quit drinking for two weeks now. I haven't had any cravings, nor anything. But except the lack of hangovers (which is awesome in itself, because it has helped me going more to the office, as I was a WFH guy because of hangovers or at least tiredness), I haven't noticed any differences in my life so far. Maybe it's too soon.\n\nBut this morning, I realised something very very obvious: except not drinking alcohol and going more to the office, I haven't made a single change in my life. I'm still glued to my screen the whole day; I'm not doing sports at all; I spend too much money on stupid stuff; my apartment is messy (for that one, I've just moved in so there's a reason but voilà); I haven't learnt any other languages; I no longer read; I don't work on my career plans.\n\nWhen I feel the motivation or the urge to change my life, I become very active and I want to fix everything in one go. But all the time, after a few days, sometimes after a day, I give up. Maybe making the \"revolution\" in one's life works for some people but obviously, it doesn't for me. So, instead of the revolution, I have to make incremental reforms. \n\nThere is one very good advice for someone wanting to quit an addiction, it's \"one day at a time\". This has helped me to not drink during 15 days and to not have felt any cravings. I have to apply the same principle to other things in my life. I will take up sports again step by step. Today, I'll exercise from home. Next week, I'll go to the gym once. If it's more, good, but the point is to go at least once per week. Then, after a few weeks, maybe a month, I'll go there twice. And so on. \n\nSame thing for learning a new language: I will start learning vocabulary 15 minutes every day. Same thing for my career pleans: I will start working on competitive exams during 15 minutes every day. Same thing for reading: I will read during 15 minutes every day. \n\nIf it's more, good. But what matters is that I do it during 15 minutes at least. And then, after a few weeks, it will be 20 minutes, then 30 minutes, etc. (at some point, after picking up the habit, I will find the perfect balance because it cannot expand indefinitely, as I couldn't work 8 hours a day on everything obviously). \n\nAll in all, it's all about creating a baseline. And mechanically, the time I'll spend working out, learning a language, etc., it will be some time off the screen, off stupid things on the internet. \n\nSo, I've started today. Today, I want to make things very simple. I have taken a good shower and will soon clean my flat. It will take me two hours, I reckon. Then, I'll work out at home. Then, I'll learn German during 15 minutes. Then, I'll make dinner for my girlfriend when she comes back from work.\n\nTomorrow, it's Sunday and I will spend quality time with my girlfriend. And I'll learn German during 15 minutes. I will also read during 15 minutes.\n\nOn Monday, I will work of course and will have to do some little chores, but I'll go to the gym in the evening. Then (or before), I'll learn German, read and work on competitive exams during 45 minutes in total. \n\nAnd so on. \n\nSorry for the long text, and thank you if you've read everything. Maybe I'll use this post as a \"journal\" to talk about my progress.\n\n", "created_utc": 1758365845.0, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nlv688/making_incremental_steps_rather_than_the/", "score": 9, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false}

{"id": "1nlf4z3", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "title": "Reflections on anger, interested in outside perspectives", "selftext": "I have been doing a lot of work with my therapist around the concept of anger. I struggle with being an incredibly passive, co-dependent person (fawn response) who internalizes anger until it builds up and I \"explode\". I struggle with vocalizing and holding healthy boundaries with others, and build resentment over time that my boundaries are being crossed (even though I am continuing to set it up that way). I will unconsciously find relationships where this dynamic is bound to form (pairing up with people who tend to test/push boundaries already - people in active addiction, people with co-occurring disorders, etc.) and then seem surprised when the cycle repeats.  \nAfter a while of avoiding my resentments/discomfort in these creative ways (by not holding boundaries or even vocalizing them sometimes), I'll finally either explode or implode. Nothing horrific, but some event will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, and I'll make it clear that I no longer want to be in community with this person (friends, dating, etc.) Like my boundary is finding a way to come out and protect me when I wouldn't do it consciously -- but when it's fueled by anger, fear, and continued mistreatment, it tends to come out as harsher than what aligns with my values.\n\nExample: I told an ex-friend once that they were being \"cruel\" and that I can't be their friend anymore (which is not a very mature way to step back from a friendship, to say something judgmental or shaming that is not in alignment with my values). I told an ex once that I found their behavior frightening and that they should see a professional therapist, which is none of my business, and, once again, I would ideally wait til things are calm and tell them kindly that I would like to end the relationship.  \nI experience a lot of guilt for not being more graceful and compassionate when ending these relationships. I know the words I used were not the worst, by far. But that's no excuse. I would like to get to a place where I am in touch with my anger as an ongoing practice, and implement boundaries when I feel injustice/mistreatment is occurring. So it doesn't come out as a resentment explosion later where I'm not coming from a centered, compassionate place.\n\nI know much of this is because I fear the feeling of anger. I had a very angry parent growing up, and associated feeling angry, even a little bit, with the terror of my mother completely losing control and going rabid. I know, logically, anger isn't a bad/unhealthy emotion, and I cannot simply 'amputate' it from my psyche (which is unconsciously what I'm doing when I'm constantly suppressing it through fawning and ignoring my own boundaries). Anger is a communication. But I'm so scared of being like my mother, that if/when I experience anger, it is somehow proof I am her child.  \nThe other part of this is also that I can see parts of these people in myself, in my own defense mechanisms, in my own past. So it feels challenging to access a sense of anger (and i default to passivity and giving \"too much\" grace). For example, the friend who I refered to as \"acting cruelly\", reminds me a lot of myself when I was their age. The ex who I pathologized reminds me of a shadow part of my own psyche, where I might be if I never reached out for professional help and healed old wounds. So I feel like if I access this inner anger towards them (if I allowed myself to even think \"wow they're such an asshole! f them!\"), I'm also saying those things to myself, in a way.

As the night went on though I really started to regret letting it go like I did. Can’t believe I just let some dude come up to me and treat me like that without standing up for myself at all. It’s been a few hours and I’m back at my apartment now and I’m still upset that I let that guy treat me like that. I guess you could say it kind of bruised my ego. I know I probably made the right decision by just letting it go but it sure doesn’t feel like the right one.

I expect my two bags will be full on the way back (flying back from my home country), so I asked if I could use one of his checked bag allowances to bring back a pots-and-pans set and some chips (both for our home, not just me).\n\nHe said no, because he doesn’t want to “deal with customs” and doesn’t want to be responsible for a bag he didn’t pack.

So, because of my future goals, I chose to take more neuroscience based classes (Cognitive Neuroscience, Visual Neuroscience) and classes like Anatomy and Physiology, etc, to really focus on my interests (and so far I’m loving my choices).\n\nBut this year is different, and so far I have been absolutely ACING all of my assignments, tests, midterms, and quizzes across all of my courses (so far).

I have taken research methods and statistics courses, so I have a background knowledge in basic and applied research, I just have no research lab experience.\n\nI need a supervisor for my senior inquiry project, in my fourth year, and I really want to ask my cognitive neuroscience professor to be my supervisor. Now, because I have not set myself up for success in my previous two years, and I don’t really know how to channel and show my curiosity in a chill, academically appropriate way, I would really appreciate any advice/guidance/whatever you can give me to move me in any direction forward that won’t make my professor uncomfortable by me asking him if he would like to be my senior inquiry supervisor.\n\nI am trying to catch up independently knowledge-wise, and I’m learning a lot on my own with regards to neuroscience, I’m even learning how to code in Python as I see many labs are listing coding as a useful skill—anything, trying to catch up on the same content others in that class likely have learned over the last few years. Also, with taking anatomy and physiology (with the department of kin), at least at my university, unlike other psych majors, I get to do a brain dissection and neurophysiology labs, which gives me a really different background than the students who don’t take A&amp;P.

She prefers me to anyone else, so we all just kind of agreed she was mine to keep.\n\nMother constantly over feeds the cats. Treats and wet food in the morning, more treats throughout the day, and even more treats at night all the while 3 food bowls around the house are kept full so they can eat whenever. \n\nShe also feeds them the wrong things with little regard to their health. And yes, I’ve tried to educate her gently. She will feed deli meat, lunch meat, rice, leftovers from plates, seasoned chicken, etc.\n\nI watched a cat, snowflake, rot from undiagnosed kidney failure from the inside out while watching my mother say we couldn’t afford a trip to the vet while she was pouring thousands into a cosmetic tummy tuck procedure for herself. About 2 weeks before her surgery she took her to the vet snd got her put down. \n\nAll of this is recent. (Past 1-3 months)\n\nHere is what happens when I try to educate her. This happened about a year ago. I told her what overfeeding does to cats and what obesity does and told her she was feeding too much. She already knew what human foods do because we got vet orders to stop feeding human food to the dog (which she followed for a bit then started continuing, her daily meal now consists of rice and greens and some chicken. A lot of rice.) and she said “I do it because I love them” and I said “Thats not love, it’s hurting them.” And she just came down harder and insisted she continue it and because I can’t say much without risking my home.. well. \n\nNow for advice givers: \nI don’t think I can change the situation itself. This morning I took the rice away from Moon and my mother put it right back, even though I said that was enough. She wanted her to eat the entire serving. (Enough for a small bowl for a human) Luckily she did swap it out for boiled chicken. Like two days before that it was lunch meat, nearly identical story.\n\nI think I moreso need to know strategies to stop it from hurting me watching this. I can’t do anything about it, im 18 but she hasn’t helped me get a life. I can’t call animal welfare because she’ll know it was me. Im at a loss, and it’s really killing me seeing this and knowing I can’t do anything. \n\nIf it gives you an idea of how well educating goes alongside the example I gave, I told her the dangers of spanking dogs and she continued anyway.

Plus, i can't remember all of the events exactly, but everything i say is true. we haven't been able to move out for financial and other reasons.\n\n*rough timeline of events:*\n\n**august 2023** \\-- moved in\n\n**2024** \\-- male neighbour (neighbours on the other side absolutely lovely and we all get along well) started showing irritation about our mini jack russell puppy barking sometimes outside (NOT much). he accused us of not looking after her properly, even though we definitely do, and her barking a lot was not a common occurrence, as we usually stopped it as soon as we could. She was also a puppy, and nowadays she rarely barks outside.\n\n**2024** \\-- he stood behind his fence, leaning on it and looking all intimidating, which made our dog bark at him. he was saying things like \"see, she's barking\" and \"why is she barking\". my mum tried to explain that our dog most likely perceived him as an unknown threat, y'know.\n\n**2024** \\-- the man came to our door, knocked, my mum answered, and he was being all intimidating and telling her off about our dog. she's not even bad, our dog! my mum got annoyed at him and tried to scare him off, saying that he's not gonna scare her by being all intimidating. you get it, he's a man.\n\n**2025** \\-- whilst entering our house, i replied to one of their annoyed queries about our dog apparently barking \"all day\" whilst we weren't at home with something like \"isn't it weird how a child is more mature than a middle-aged man\" to him. well, i was 17, not a child, but that's still a big difference in supposed maturity between me and a middle-aged man, I'd say...\n\n**2025** \\-- he and his girlfriend mentioned something about stomping up the stairs and how they can hear it at night (9 pm and later, they said) when they're trying to sleep. i thought that was understandable and fair enough, so i tried consciously to go up the stairs quietly at night. Sometimes my sibling still wouldn't be quiet going up the stairs, as they can be quite careless in that department... but other than that, it was all good.\n\nmaybe a few weeks later, the male neighbour and his girlfriend thanked my mum because apparently it had been a lot better! good!!\n\n**2025** \\-- whilst entering our house, i replied to one of their annoyed queries outside our front door about our dog apparently barking \"all day\" whilst we weren't at home. i defended our dog and said about how she's never done it before that we know of, but she's rarely left at home by herself anyway. My grandma's dog was home with our dog, who got (she's not alive now) very excited and breathy whenever she heard a potential sign of my grandma coming back to collect her, which probably (in fact, nearly certainly) created the problem of our dog also barking. which means our neighbours were angry over a one-time thing, and when i say angry, i mean they were waiting for us in between their and ours driveways with their arms crossed (i think!).\n\n**15th september 2025 (today)** \\-- he shouted/yelled (and im not over exaggerating) at my mum and i when we were getting in the car (around 7:30 am) something along the lines of \"will you stop banging up the f\\*cking stairs\" (i seem to remember him using the word banging, even though that doesnt reaaally make sense sentence wise.

It didn't wake him up as it was less than 5 mins before he shouted at us/me, and he was already dressed.\n\ni didn't really feel scared at the time, just shocked, but now my mum and i have just gotten home (we finish school and work at similar times, so she takes me home), and i felt really anxious when we arrived home in the car, like actually scared. i felt fine till then. it's been like 30 mins since we got home, and i still feel shaky and weird. my mum just told me she's leaving a complaint on some website (think it's a council housing one).\n\ni feel really guilty too, but my mum said i've not done anything wrong, even if i stomped up the stairs several times a day. i also feel like i'm overreacting, especially because i feel scared that he'd even hurt us. this is because my mum said she feels like going to his door and talking to him about it, to, i guess, tell him off and say how it's scared me. i've had a similar experience before with another man, which probably made it worse.\n\nNot really a potential tl;dr, as you need the context for this to make a suitable opinion. this is all i remember at this point in time.

I'm not american, so we don't have dorms and I live at home. My college is expensive, and my family was amazed that I was studying there just like my aunt. I've stated multiple times during my college semesters that I'd like to study an additional major, from primary education to design. I've said before that I don't exactly like my career and made a comment a year ago about dropping global studies and studying something else and my mother simply ignored me and said she didn't agree. \n\nPoint is: a week ago I realized that I genuinely hate my degree. When I go to classes I feel the impulse to scream or leave, I have no passion for it and I can't envision myself in politics. I don't relate to any of classmates, and every semester I end up isolating myself for a few weeks and avoiding classes, getting depressed every single time I speak with my friends of said degree. So I told my dad I wanted to switch majors to anthropology since it's the one theme of my classes that I felt passionate about and I've always been fascinated by people, culture and history. I would graduate a semester later if I went for anthropology, since we have common classes with that major and I wouldn't be starting from zero. \n\nMy dad agreed to my decision and said I could always count on him, but when I talked to my mother she was completely against it and said I was indecisive, it's normal to hate our degrees like she did but nobody forced me to choose mine (when she has always been on me with my aunt talking about what i should do/shouldn't), and that she thinks I'm wasting my time. She asked about my dad, and when I told her he was on my side, she said she'd speak to him. Later that day before leaving for my classes I saw she received an audio text from my dad. When I was going to take my bus, I received an audio from my dad saying he takes it all back, I should finish my major and then I could get some specialization that I liked, but that I'm wasting my time. He was saying the same things my mother said to me, so we fought. He said I should work instead of continuing my education if I hated my major so much. \n\nLater this week, we kept fighting while mom insisted on getting me a vocational coach. I agreed, until she told me she doesn't know what she'd do if he agreeing with me. Yesterday, she told me I don't have to turn my passions into degrees and they should stay as hobbies (while I was talking about biological anthropology) and that I chose my major, nobody else, and I had no pressure whatsoever and what I was doing was wasting money and time. She said she doesn't want to be an hypocrite and said she'd support me, when she wouldn't. I'm indecisive, and maybe I'm just not ready to continue at my college and she agrees with my dad, that maybe the best is to make me drop from college and to put me into work. I left and had a full blown panic attack while she kept screaming from outside my room saying that I was impossible to handle and that's why nobody ever talks to me. \n\n  \nI have no idea what to do. I hate my degree, I felt so distant from it, and I know they're threatening me. It's either their way or no education.

He convinced me I’d make everything back and every project he said we had fell through, I was later told by the owner the demo work boat sailed because he had not shown up for some days on a project and the contracting manager didn’t want him to do demo anymore because of inconsistency after asking if I could do some side work at discount to make ends meet and because I’m directly affiliated with my friend I wouldn’t be given the chance because of his actions. \n\nI sacrificed everything to be here and I was worried about signing a lease since I spent 7k in less than two months relocating to LA and trying to get resources to build a sales team(branded shirts, cards, getting website back up). The owner doesn’t care much because all his work comes from referrals and we would just be bonuses by bring in extra revenue if we got the self generated sales side going. I did this in MN and was successful, so I thought between us both we could accomplish wonderful things until he gave up entirely after getting his check. Now he wants to DJ, bought a bunch of music equipment. Keeps promising we are going to still build the company but zero action.\n\nAnyway - now I don’t even have money for my phone bill, food, any necessities this month and he’s unwilling to help me out at all. I was  I was afraid of signing because I didn’t have a job but ended up getting hired hours after this whole fiasco happened. I don’t know what to do because it’s commission with only 500 per week for 3 weeks as base pay. I was planning on signing the lease but he has been doing strange things that make me uncomfortable aside from signing the lease without my consent two days ago. This is becoming very toxic very quick and now I feel like I was just a discount on he and his girlfriends rent after sacrificing everything to be here. I don’t even have money for a flight to go back to FL. I am stuck and only hope is that this job is legit as I have quite a few red flags from the company already. What the hell do I do? I needed to talk to him about my concerns and feeling before agreeing to this lease but he signed for me within 5 minutes of me walking down the street to check on my families medical conditions. Even after explaining how I felt he told me my concerns aren’t valid and this is all part of being here to creat a dream. Am I crazy? I was yelled at for eating some pretzel sticks last night, I was so hungry and had been just getting cans of tuna fish to eat. Meanwhile he eats out for every meal or only gets groceries to groceries to feed he and his girl but when I first got here I bought groceries for everyone and cooked meals for everyone and now I’m left out of everything. \n\nI am at a loss of words, bamboozled, bewildered and in shock. This is only a small amount of what’s negatively transpired since being here. I should have left before it ever got this far but believed in him and his promises that everything was going to work out. What would you do in my situation? \n\nSorry for such a long post and taking the time to read it if you get through my book of text and venting to the world.
